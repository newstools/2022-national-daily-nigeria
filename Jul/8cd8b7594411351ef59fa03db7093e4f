The Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries has refuted a social media report purporting that the presidential candidate of Labour Party in the 2023 general election, Peter Obi, has been endorsed by the General Overseer, Pastor Lazarus Muoka, and the Church.
Reports had emerged on social media that Pastor Lazarus was supporting Peter Obi.
The Public Relations Director of the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries, Pastor Louis Chidi, in a statement, declared that neither the General Overseer nor the Church ever made any political statement in support of, or against any person or party, and have no cause to be involved in politics.
Pastor Louis Chidi in the statement declared: “Our attention has been drawn to publications on some social media platforms attributed to our General Overseer, Pastor Lazarus Muoka, which were meant to portray him and the Church, the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries, as politically inclined with sympathy for a particular political party and its aspirant.
“We wish to state without equivocation that neither our General Overseer nor the Church has ever made any political statement in support of, or against any person or party, and have no cause to be involved in politics.
“We, therefore, wish to state categorically that such publication or view does not emanate from our General Overseer. Rather, it’s the enemy that has done that (according to Matthew 13:24-30).”
