17-months-old toddler Layla Davis, who has been compared to famous scientist Albert Einstein and former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson because of her remarkable wild locks has been diagnosed with an ‘uncombable hair syndrome’ (UHS) earlier this month.
The condition, which develops in childhood, is characterized by dry, frizzy hair that cannot be combed flat.
Those who develop it tend to have light-colored hair – and there are only around 100 cases in the entire world.
Mum Charlotte Davis, from Great Blakenham, Suffolk, said she wants her daughter to grow up knowing it is ‘awesome’ even though she looks different from others.

‘She was fluffy from when she was about one and then after that, it started growing more and more outwards,’ the 28-year-old parent added.
‘I think I was in denial and kept saying it was going to go flat.
‘I was really proud to get the diagnosis because it’s so rare. Part of the reason I delayed getting her tested for it is because there’s only one hundred people with it in the world – the chances of having it are so slim.
‘I don’t know if it’s because other people ruffle and touch her hair but she’s started doing it herself.
‘I have a little boy who is two and has noticed his hair isn’t the same and sometimes he will stroke his hair and then her hair. I don’t think she realizes how awesome it is.’
Her mum said that some people have nicknamed her daughter after the prime minister and the famous scientist Einstein.
There has been much speculation about the outgoing Tory leader’s hair in the past, with some suggesting he might also have UHS.
While there is no cure, the condition usually gets better or goes away completely around the start of puberty.
