Family of former governor of Oyo state, Victor Omololu Olunloyo has confirmed that the 87-year-old man is not dead but in a critical condition that needs prayer.
Oyo Affairs had earlier reported that Olunloyo, who is the father of social media journalist Kemi Olunloyo, died Friday afternoon in Ibadan.
However, the family in a statement said he has been moved to the intensive care unit at University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan.
The message from the family reads: “We appreciate the public for the interest shown in the well-being of our father, Chief Dr. Victor Omololu Sowemimo OLUNLOYO (aka VOSO).

“As a public figure, we believe that his condition should not be hidden from the Nigerian public who have a right to know about their leaders.
“Please accept our most sincere thanks for your all concern and goodwill. May God Almighty bless you all and our dear country Nigeria.”
