Investigative journalist, Babajide Otitoju, has revealed that some demands from the civil servants in Osun State may have cost Governor Oyetola his re-election bid in Osun State. Analyzing the election results on TVC News, Babajide said only a few civil servants may have voted for the governor at the governorship poll.
Addressing the topic, Babajide said, “In my view, APC lost in the areas dominated by civil servants, pensioners, and retirees.” The APC also lost the government house polling unit. This tells you that the civil servants, a critical voting block in any election, did not vote for the governor, or only a few of them may have voted for the governor. I investigated the reason behind their actions, as the governor always paid their salary in full and he did not miss their payment.
He continued, “I learned that the civil servants wanted the arrears owed before the governor got into office to be paid. There were also pension arrears amounting to billions of Naira. However, the administration was always saddled with a lot of debts. There were situations when Osun State received zero allocation from the federation account. The governor ensured that they neither owed salary nor acquired new loans, like some governors do these days.
