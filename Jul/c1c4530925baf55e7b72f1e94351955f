Speaking in an interview on Channels Television, Utomi expressed hope of the Labour Party which he is a member of, winning the 2023 presidential election.
The Labour Party member who pointed out that the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) have political commissions in every state of the federation, stated that the party will mobilize people during the forthcoming polls to ensure that every polling booth is covered.
Decrying a situation whereby those in public office would steal money to rig elections, a situation he said people have mistaken to be political structures, Utomi explained that the scenario whereby politicians bribe their way during elections is changing as the people want a different narrative.
He said;
“Labour Party has a superstructure, much better than the structures APC and the PDP have.
“The Labour Party is built around the labor movement and a college of civil society organizations.
“With the structure that we have, I am guaranteeing that on the election day, in every polling station in this country, there are at least 15 people who are standing up for the third force to support the Labour party candidate.”
On the possibility of a merger with other parties, the Labour party chieftain stated that talks are ongoing with several political parties, although he did not disclose any specific one.
When asked why he’s confident of the Labour party’s victory, he berated the performance of both APC and PDP that have ruled Nigeria.
