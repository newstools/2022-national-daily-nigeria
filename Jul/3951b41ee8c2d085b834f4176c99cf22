A former lawmaker representing Rivers South-East senatorial district, Magnus Abe says his decision to quit the All Progressives Congress is not unconnected with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s seeming unwillingness to negotiate with him since he expected him to remain in the APC.
Speaking on Arise TV on Wednesday, Abe explained that it was time to move on with his ambition, having served this country as a Lawmaker in the Rivers State House of Assembly, SSG of Rivers State, and Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Abe further stated that he would be contesting against the ruling party in the 2023 governorship race.
The former lawmaker in a letter addressed to the National Chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu, sighted by our correspondent, tendered his resignation from the party.

He further stated that his decision to dump the party is linked to the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu failing to negotiate with him to remain in the party.
Abe promised to reveal his next political platform in the coming days.
The letter reads, “I wish to tender my resignation of membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
“My decision to quit is not unconnected with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s seeming unwillingness to negotiate with me since he expects me to remain in the APC. Hence my resolve to seek an alternative platform to actualize my Gubernatorial Ambition in Rivers State.
“Let me also use this moment to thank my teeming supporters, and some of those that defected from the APC, for standing by me in all these years, more importantly, *H.E Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
In the latest development, the former lawmaker has distanced himself from the trending letter, and he does not have issues with Tinubu.
He, however, insisted that he is no longer a member of the Rivers State APC.
