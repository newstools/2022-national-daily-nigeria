The party’s flag-bearer Bola Tinubu chose a fellow Muslim and former Gov Kashim Shettima as his vice president, thereby enraging many who claim it’s an Islamization agenda.
The unveiling took place Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja, dressed in their robes amid heavy security at the venue.
The Christian Association of Nigeria and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria have kicked against the ticket, condemning it as insensitive.
But Tinubu and his party insist it their final decision, and the goal is not religious but winning the 2023 presidential election.
