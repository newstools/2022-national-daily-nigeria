“I go reach polling unit see men dey vote for Atiku or Tinubu. How far? Una go understand.
“If you know say you no go vote Peter Obi, no come out…no come out”, he said and as he cocked his gun.
His threat in a trending video has since attracted the attention of security agencies.
According to PRNigeria, security agents will soon arrest the man holding a gun in the video.
“The young man, suspected to be an IPOB militant, issued his ‘murder’ threat in a viral 30-second video which circulated on social media,” the security news platform quoted a source as saying.
“It is quite disturbing when the armed criminal vowed that come 2023, he will shoot and kill persons at polling units, who attempt to vote either Atiku or Tinubu.”
Obi’s supporters refer to themselves as Obidients, and have demonstrated tendencies for online aggression.
Obi has however dissociated himself from many of them, and warned others to be tolerant.
