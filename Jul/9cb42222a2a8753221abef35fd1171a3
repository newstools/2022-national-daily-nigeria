The leader of the Ilana Omo Oodua group, Professor Banji Akintoye has reacted to a circulating report suggesting that he had constituted a committee to support Tinubu’s presidential bid. In an exclusive report by SaharaReporters hours ago, it was alleged that Professor Akintoye set up a team in a bid to lobby Yoruba professionals and elites to back the aspiration of the APC presidential candidate. The report further alleged that Akintoye met with a popular Ado-Ekiti medical doctor identified as Adebayo Orire.According to SaharaReporters, Orire is a chieftain of the APC and he is also the chairman of the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) in Ekiti State.
In a video which was shared on the Facebook handle of Sunday Igboho’s spokesman, Professor Banji Akintoye confirmed that he had a meeting with the famous doctor in Benin Republic few days ago. The renowned historian noted that he had discussion with Orire alongside representatives from the Ekiti chapter of the Ilana Omo Oodua. 

‘Throughout the meeting, no one mentioned any presidential candidate. Many people from several self-determination groups often come to meet me and I always offer my help to them. I never met with any APC politician. I only told Orire to help persuade other elites and professionals to support our agitation.’
When a group of journalists interviewed Banji Akintoye in the francophone country few weeks ago, the highly respected academian was quoted by Punch saying that Tinubu would have been his ideal candidate for the 2023 presidency if everything is okay in the country. He has however denied constituting a team to support Tinubu.
