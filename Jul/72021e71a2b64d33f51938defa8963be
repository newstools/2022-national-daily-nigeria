The Redeemed Christian Church of God has denied meeting/endorsing the All Progressives Congress and its Presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.



The church described the claim of endorsing the ruling party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket as false, adding that its General Overseer, Pastor E.A. Adeboye is under the authority of God, the Christian Association of Nigeria, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, and will not speak on behalf of Christians on issues regarding policies.



The RCCG further stated that Adeboye and the church will not endorse any candidate in the 2023 general election in Nigeria.



The church also threatened to seek legal redress should such claim be made again.
