In June, the National Grid collapsed for the fifth time this year resulting in nationwide power outage.
The Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu had last month attributed the low electricity supply across the country to gas supply challenges.
The Minister in a statement by his media aide, Malam Isa Sanusi explained that the “dip in electricity generation is as a result of the partial shutdown of the Oben gas plant to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment”.
The government noted that the “incident unfortunately occurred at a time when other power plants on other gas sources are undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing.
