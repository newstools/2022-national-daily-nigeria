Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress party (AAC) has reacted to an ongoing petition which was made to ban Reno Omokri from Twitter. The petition was made as Reno Omokri was accused of inciting ethnic war through his posts.
Taking to social media (Facebook), Sowore made a post to condemn the petition, he alleged that the petition was vastly signed by Peter Obi’s supporters and he advised those behind it to take it down.
He said that a petition is not supposed to be made against Reno for exercising his freedom of speech.
