During a question and answer session on her Instagram page, the actress alleged that Fabiyi told her to pick between having a relationship with him or being his enemy.
Asked if there was a sex-for-role dispute between them, Mo Bimpe replied, “NO! In fact he didn’t ask me out till we finished his movie I featured in (tho he said if he knew I was going to turn him down then he would have done that before shooting the movie). We don’t relate cos he insisted on either dating me or being enemies and I had to choose.”
