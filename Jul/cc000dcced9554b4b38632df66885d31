As opinions about the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket rage, General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry has put in his oar too.
Addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Ilorin, shortly after he paid courtesy to Gov. Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara, Kumuyi said that presidential flagbearers of various political parties should look at the heartbeat of Nigeria and the desires of people before making their decisions.
“The Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christan ticket is a difficult and slippery area, ” he said.
The APC presidential flagbearer Bola Tinubu and his party took that slippery way to make Borno Sen and ex- Gov Kashiim Shettima his running mate.
“What I will say is that the political office holders should look at the heartbeat of the country as well as desires of the people,” the pastor said.
“Politicians should know that they are not there for themselves. They are there for all of us. They should ask and make their research about what the nation wants.
“They should ask and make their research on what the country wants, what the people want; if they listen to the people, we will be confident that they will listen to us when they get there,” he said.
The octogenarian is considered, by many, a pro-government preacher because he always asks for prayers for Nigeria’s leaders instead of confronting them.
