Nigerian celebrity singer, David Adeleke popularly known by his stage name as Davido took to Twitter just a few minutes ago to reply a fan who earlier enquired to know if he is on the side of Peter Obi, Atiku Abubakar or Ahmed Bola Tinubu ahead of the 2023 presidential election.


The fan had responded to a tweet by Davido by asking Davido if he is supporting the presidential candidate of labour party, Peter Obi [“OBidient”], the presidential candidate of the people’s democratic party, Atiku Abubakar [ “Atikulated”] or the presidential candidate of the all progressives congress, Ahmed Bola Tinubu [ “Jagabanist”] ahead of the 2023 presidential election.
While responding to the fan’s question, Davido simply replied “Osun”. Davido’s reply simply means that he is more focused on the forthcoming governoship election in Osun state because his uncle, Ademola Adeleke is the governorship candidate of the people’s democratic party.
You will recall that Davido is a Nigerian singer and music producer who is considered to be one of the best singers in Africa.
