National Daily understands that the 23-year-old was believed to be desperate to join Chelsea last summer but the Stamford Bridge club refused to activate a £67m release clause in his contract, which was Sevilla’s asking price.
Barcelona are believed to have agreed personal terms with Chelsea target Jules Kounde
Though Chelsea were understood to have maintained their interest in the last 12 months and they’d been expected to reignite a move for Kounde this summer, particularly after the departures of their star defenders Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger.
But National Daily can confirm from the claim by Gerard Romero – who broke news of Christensen’s move to Barcelona – says the Catalans have now won the race for Kounde too
It’s claimed Kounde has agreed a salary and contract with Barcelona and all that remains is for the Spaniards to agree a fee with Sevilla.
Barcelona’s financial problems means they can’t activate Kounde’s release clause but they’ll attempt to include a player to bring down the price.
It is however understood that Kounde’s transfer will involve the swap deal that will see Memphis Depay move to Sevilla, with the club in need of an attacker after Anthony Martial’s departure.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that Chelsea are closing in on a move for Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly, with the Blues prepared to pay up to £40m for the Senegal ace.
Thomas Tuchel wants at least one centre-back this summer and it remains to be seen if they will attempt to rival Barcelona for Kounde’s signature.
The Blues will reluctantly allow Cesar Azpilicueta to leave Stamford Bridge, though they want to recoup the £7m they paid for him a decade ago.
The Spaniard has agreed a two-year deal to join Barcelona.
