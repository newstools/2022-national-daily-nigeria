In an interview with Njenje Media TV regarding his widely read essay, “Bola Ahmed Tinubu: From Drug Lord To Presidential Candidate,” Hundeyin stated that he is captivated by Tinubu’s character and would like to dissect it for a deeper understanding.
Hundeyin said that the negative history Tinubu is said to carry is not unique to him. He noted that many Nigerian politics have history in drug trafficking.
“This isn’t something that is unique to Tinubu. But what strikes me about him is that he is not just somebody with a bad past, made his money and went to sit somewhere and eat it quietly, which is what most people do; instead, this guy wants to be president.
“The same kind of thought process that Pablo Escobar had, where he thought that his drug money, or his dirty money, was enough to get him anything he wanted, up to and including the Presidency.
“This man is trying to do the same thing. From the point of view of a storyteller, this struck me as a good story to tell.”
