There was heightening tension in the Korean Peninsula after North Korea on Sunday fired multiple rocket launchers in the region.
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff on Sunday raised alarm that the country’s military detected “flight trajectories” suspected to be shot from North Korean artillery.
According to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a text message: “Our military spotted flight trajectories that are suspected to be North Korea’s multiple rocket launchers from around 18.21 to 18.37pm today.
“Our military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance and maintained a thorough readiness posture while keeping close US-South Korea cooperation.”
The presidential National Security Office in the South was said to have held a meeting over the North’s firing; disclosing the military are “closely monitoring” the situation in case of additional launches by North Korea.
The North may have been provoked by the U.S./South Korea military alliance in the region and the annual military exercise in the Peninsula.
America had last week moved six US top-of-the-line F-35A fighters into South Korea for a 10-day allied exercise which will end on July 14. This was said to be the first public deployment of American stealth warplanes since late 2017.
