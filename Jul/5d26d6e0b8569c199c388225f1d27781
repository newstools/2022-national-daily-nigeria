Speaking during an interview on Arise Television on Sunday, Kwakwanso warned Tinubu to pay attention to his health.
“If you see my friend, Bola, tell him to take it easy, take good care of his health and make sure that… because I love him so much, he is my friend,” he said.
“This campaign is very rigorous, it requires a lot of effort and so on and so forth. I hope he will take it easy so that we can continue the struggle to ensure one solid and prosperous Nigeria,” he said.
Tinubu’s health has been a major concern his critics raise to point at his ineligibility to run for presidency.
The APC national leader spent months in London fixing a kneecap before he declared his intention to run for the highest office in 2033.
He however insists it’s God that gives or takes life.
