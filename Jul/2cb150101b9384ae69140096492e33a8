Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State on Friday revealed that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has succumbed to pressures to adopt a northern Muslim as running mate in the 2023general elections.
Ganduje hosting about 100 clerics at the Kano State Government House for the Eid El Kabir celebration, stated: “We have advised him to pick a Muslim deputy and he has agreed.
“A Muslim-Muslim ticket is a reality. It is not something new in Nigeria.”
The governor demanded the Islamic clerics to pray for Tinubu to win the presidential election in 2023.
Meanwhile, there has been intense lobby in the north for the running mate slot of Tinubu.  Some APC stakeholders are jostling for Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, others for Senator Shettima, former Borno governor, while some others are routing for Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State. Some had suggested Governor Solomon Lalong of Plateau State.
Tinubu had a fortnight ago said that he is still searching for a running mate.
