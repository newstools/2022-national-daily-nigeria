The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Thursday revealed that the restoration of the National Grid which collapsed on Wednesday has been completed.
The General Manager of TCN, Ndidi Mbah, in a statement on Thursday indicated that the national grid experienced system disturbance at about 11.27am on Wednesday. He explained that the collapse was a result of a sudden drop in system frequency from 49.94Hz to 47.36Hz, which created system instability.
She emphasized that reports from the National Control Centre (NCC) showed the  collapse was caused by the tripping of a Unit (with a load of 106 MW) in one of the generating stations due to “Exhaust over Temperature”.
Mbah noted that the incident which pulled out other grid-connected Units in the plant, resulted in aggregated generation loss of 457MW. She added that a train of events ensued – culminating in the collapse of the national grid.
Mbah also clarified: “as obtainable in all systems, when a component of the electric power system is defective, the entire configuration is vitiated. However, in spite of setbacks encountered at the initial stage, grid restoration had almost been completed as at 11.00pm when this report was filed.”
Mbah assured that the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry is committed to leveraging the concerted interventions instituted thus far to enhance power supply reliability so that the issue of system collapse will soon become a thing of the past.
The General Manager, however, revealed that TCN has commenced a full-scale investigation to establish the cause of the last collapse.
