Romelu Lukaku has acknowledged it was “a mistake” to go for Chelsea’s £98 million ($116 million) transfer and that he had always planned to return to Inter. The Belgian international returned to the Premier League in the summer of 2021 and broke records at Stamford Bridge, but he has since returned to Italy.
In 44 appearances, the 29-year-old frontman scored just 15 goals due to his inability to adapt to Thomas Tuchel’s tactical demands in west London.
It was rapidly decided that switching for a loan to San Siro would be the wisest course of action for everyone involved.
Accepting that his decision to push for a second spell at Chelsea was a mistake for his career.

At a ceremony to unveil Inter’s new uniform for the 2022–23 season, he declared:“This season there will be the biggest challenge of my career. 

I left. 

A mistake was made.

It will be a big challenge this season, and we need to keep playing like this, so I’m thrilled to be donning this jersey right now.


“Last season, when I was in England, I became aware of Inter’s global significance. The club’s reputation is raising on a global level, the social media strategy is crucial, and you can observe how we behave in the locker room, during practice, and with our embraces and laughs.
Because my mother frequently visited Milan, I decided to keep the previous apartment when I moved to London because I wanted to come back myself.
