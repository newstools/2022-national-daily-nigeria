The Super Falcons’ dominance on the African continent has gone unchallenged for almost two decades.
The Nigerians have successfully won all nine finals while conceding in just one of them when they defeated South Africa 4-2 in the 2010 edition.
Apart from only two occasions (2008 & 2012) when the Super Falcons suffered upsets in their semi-final games, the girls have gotten to every other final of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations.
But sadly, the Super Falcons of Nigeria had begun their challenge on the ongoing WAFCON on a disappointing note after falling 1-2 to the Bayana Bayana of South Africa in their opening Group C encounter.
And as they struggle to return to winning ways in their make or mar clash against Botswana on Thursday, the squad has been dealt a big blow with the losing of their a talented player and talisman Asisat Oshoala who has been ruled out of the competition after sustaining an injury in their defeat against South Africa.
It therefore becomes a tall order for Coach Randy Waldrum to exploit the absence of her star player to raise the rest of his players after the American emerged as the first non-indigene to take the Falcons to WAFCON especially as Nigerian football fans are of the opinion that their players are better than any other on the continent.
Meanwhile, the players need to be humble enough to put in the effort to get the job done. That comes from being humble in assessing and juxtaposing ability with effort. The best talents with no effort are just as average as the poor team, who with humility put in the hard yards.
Another defeat for the Super Falcons today (Thursday) will definitely spell doom for the nine-time winners.
