There was commotion in the early hours of Thursday at the new domestic terminal of the Lagos Airport aka MMA2 when passengers booked on Dana Air engaged in wanton destruction of facilities.
The passengers were miffed over poor communication on the part of Dana Air on indefinite suspension of its operations by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).
Recall that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) had suspended the Airline’s air transport licence (ATL) and air operator certificate (AOC) following the discovery that it could meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.
This year, the airline has reported two incidents with its aircraft with the latest being the incident that happened on Wednesday when one of its aircraft made an emergency landing at the Nnamdi Azikwe international airport in Abuja.

However, on Thursday unaware of the suspension, passengers numbering 100 expressed reservations on the absence of personnel of the suspended carrier at the departure hall to brief them on the next line of action over possible transfer to other partner airlines or refund of their ticket fares.
While security officials of the terminal manager: Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited made frantic efforts to calm some of the passengers, others snatched the glass windows of the airline’s counters.
With no solution in sight, some of the passengers went berserk disrupting activities at the departure hall of the terminal.
But Dana Air management said its operations have been suspended by the NCAA for a full operational audit.
