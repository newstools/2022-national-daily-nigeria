A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Jimi Agbaje, on Wednesday refuted report purporting his defection to All Progressives Congress (APC) from the PDP.
Agbaje inisisted that he has not dumped the PDP for the ruling APC to support the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential election.
Agbaje had declared: “I think it is one of the downsides of social media where mischief makers can just throw up anything and it is out there. There is no truth whatsoever in it, I remain in the PDP. So, this is smoke without fire.
“I woke up this morning to read the news just like anybody. Normally they say there is no smoke without fire, but I think this is a case of where there is smoke, there is no fire because there is no fire in the first place.”
