In a live video on his official Facebook page, Tuesday, July 5, the founder of the defunct Niger Delta People’s Volunteer Force declared that the ‘Obi-dient’ movement, which is currently going on, is a “scam”
“There is a scammer in town. Peter Obi is scamming people with lies and people are believing him.
“This is nauseating. Peter Obi was a governor of Anambra State for eight years.
“How would you compare Obi with Tinubu or Atiku? What is his antecedent? Lies. You are showing documents that you rejected land.
“Everyone knows it’s the governor who issues C of O; it’s common sense.”
Days ago, letters Obi and one of his appointees exchanged while he was Anambra governor surfaced.
In his own, Obi rejected a letter of allocation mandating him to pay N100,000 for two plots of land for 99 years—like every other buyer of land in the GRA.
But those behind the letter attempted to pass it on like Obi was incorruptible.
All of te major candidates contesting the 2023 presidential election, including Obi have been exposed as stashing billions away in tax haves by using proxies and shell companies.
