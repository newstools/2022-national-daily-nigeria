This followed a new directive from the Nigeria Police High Command allegedly given earlier this month, directing the increment of the fees for PCC from N5,000 to N40,000.
The increment is a 700 percent increase from the original fee of N5,000.
Before this official hike, the actual price was known as it could range from as low as N5,000 to as high as N100,000, depending on the police officer one approaches or the individual requesting for it.
The PCC is a document issued by the Nigeria Police to certify that an individual does not have a criminal record, criminal conviction, or is trying to evade prosecution for crimes committed in the country.
