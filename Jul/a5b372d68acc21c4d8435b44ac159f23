Russian politicians are celebrating the downfall of Boris Johnson, casting the British leader as a “stupid clown” who had finally got his just reward for arming Ukraine against Russia.
“He doesn’t like us, we don’t like him either,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said shortly before Johnson stood in Downing Street to announce his resignation.
Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska said on Telegram that it was an “inglorious end” for a “stupid clown” whose conscience would be blighted by “tens of thousands of lives in this senseless conflict in Ukraine”.
“The clown is going,” Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, said. “He is one of the main ideologues of the war against Russia until the last Ukrainian. European leaders should think about where such a policy leads.”
