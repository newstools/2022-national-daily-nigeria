Political activist, Aisha Yesufu has responded to Tolu Ogunlesi, the special assistant on digital and new media to President Muhammadu Buhari, after he took to Twitter to ask why people consider the All Progressive Congress, APC and the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, as the same but see the Labour Party, LP, as a different political party.

The argument tabled by the media aide is that both Presidential candidates ever presented by the APC (President Muhammadu Buhari and now Bola Ahmed Tinubu), had never been members of the PDP but the candidates that has been presented by the Labour Party (Peter Obi, Doyin Okupe and Datti Baba Ahmed), have all at one time or the other been members of the PDP before leaving to join the Labour Party.
Tolu Ogunlesi went further to state that politics forces people to ask uneasy questions and contest easy assumptions and that is why he wants everyone to reason together.
In response to his Tweet, Aisha Yesufu, the co-founder of the Bring-Back-Our-Girls movement, dropped a few tweets where she gave instances of the similarities between the APC and the PDP, especially during the tenure of ex-president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and the current tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari.
According to Aisha Yesufu, when the Nigerian army wrote to PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan in the past as well as APC’s Muhammadu Buhari, complaining of what they were going through, both of them allegedly ignored their complaints.
In a separate tweet, Aisha Yesufu also claimed that Nigeria’s excess crude account suffered depletion under the regime of President Goodluck Jonathan and got finished under President Buhari, suffering a fall from $20 billion in the year 2009 to a meagre $2.07 billion in May 2015.
Going further, Aisha also alleged that the media suffers under the APC just as it did under the PDP and these are some of the reasons why people say that both parties are the same and not because of their initials or the people that make up the parties.
