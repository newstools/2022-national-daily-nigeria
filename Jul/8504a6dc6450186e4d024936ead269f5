According to the Planning and Strategy Committee of the Bola Tinubu Campaign Organisation, the federal lawmakers are angry at the outcome of the party primaries across the nation.
The committee, chaired by another protester and ex-SGF Lawal Babachir, revealed this in a report– Actualisation of the Presidency of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the Coming 2023 General Election—submitted to the party.
“It is worrisome that 22 serving senators and 170 National Assembly members are set to defect from the APC,” the report stated in part.
“There is no doubt that this can weaken our strength and there is an urgent need for intervention from the President, our presidential candidate, governors, leaders of the National Assembly, the APC national, state, zonal and local working committees as well as influential party stakeholders.”
In its recommendation, the committee urges President Muhammdu Buhari and Tinubu to meet with the aggrieved federal lawmakers to head off their defections.
“Defecting to other parties is quite common during electioneering but it is more worrisome for this election as a lot of influential members feel aggrieved with the processes of the elections,” the report added
“There is a need to reach out to the principal officers of the National Assembly and the party leadership at the national, state, zonal and local government levels to mitigate and assuage the aggrieved persons.”
Fresh and younger aspirants, with the support of their governors, upstaged the older ones in the primaries. Others gambled with the presidential primary, and lost out.
Among those who lost out are Sen. President Ahmed Lawan, Sen. Adeyemi Smart, and many others.
