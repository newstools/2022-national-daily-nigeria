NNPP’s presidential candidate Rabiu Kwakwanso has said that the activities of Biafra agitators in the South-East will not allow the proposed alliance with the LP candidate Peter Obi work out well.
According to the senator, he would have liked to be Obi’s running mate, since he is currently jobless.
But he insisted northern voters will never vote any presidential candidate from the South-East.
“That is what the enemy outside there is saying [that I should be running mate to Peter Obi. The implication is that if you put somebody from the South-East, unfortunately, there are many issues in the South-East.
“You see, the northern voter is the worst hit in this issue of maladministration In this country. But even in that circumstance, the northern voter believes he is better off with one united Nigeria.
“Therefore, most of the things that are happening in the South, especially the South-East, people are not comfortable with that and as long as you have anybody from there in any party, it would be very difficult for the northern voter to vote.”
