The court also ordered the forfeiture of cars traced to Mrs Egbuha, a teacher with Ozala Primary School, Abagana, Anambra State. Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in a statement on Thursday, July 18, said the forfeited money and cars form part of the N540 million proceeds of crime traced to Mrs. Egbuha.
“The teacher who was on a monthly salary of N76,000 as at the time of her arrest in 2020 by ICPC, had N540 million stashed in her bank account with Guaranty Trust Bank. Further investigations by ICPC revealed her alleged complicity in money laundering thereby prompting the Commission to place a Post-No-Debit (PND) on the account.
