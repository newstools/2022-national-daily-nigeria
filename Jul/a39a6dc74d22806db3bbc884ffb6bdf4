The Emir of Yandoton Daji, Aliyu Marafa, at the Emir’s palace in Yandoton daji, Tsafe Local Government Area, Zamfara State, turbaned bandits’ leader, Ado Aleru, Seriki, of the Fulani of Yandoton Daji Emirate in the state.
Aliyu Marafa was identified as a notorious bandit terrorist tormenting communities in Katsina State and Tsafe zone in Zamfara State killing and kidnapping people over the years.
Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State had created two emirates in May, carving Yandoton Daji out of Tsafe emirate.
The emir disclosed that the turban of Ado Aleru as seriki was a show of appreciation for the terrorist’s consent to ceasefire, which he said has restored relative peace in the environs. He noted that ceasefire was one of the requests to terrorists’ leaders for their rehabilitation.
The turban ceremony was said to be attended by some notorious bandit leaders, including their lieutenants at the palace of the Emir of Yantodon daji.
