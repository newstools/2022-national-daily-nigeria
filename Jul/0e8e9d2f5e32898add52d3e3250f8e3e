In few months from now, the tenth session of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is expected to be inaugurated by a brand new president of the republic, if all things being equal and if democracy is not imperiled by the gross incompetence of the current persons wielding the powers that-be in Abuja.
But just before the National Assembly’s election and the inauguration of the next session of the senate next June, there are considerable debates regarding the performance status and existential relevance of the current elected legislators at the upper chamber of the legislative house in Abuja.
There are also, groundswells of skepticism and doubts surrounding the implementation of constituency projects and the quality of bills introduced and passed successfully by the legislators.
Many of the law makers are simply sleeping at the two chambers of the National Assembly just as many have been caught red handed stealing from the public till, the resources meant for the implementation of constituency projects.
However, few of the Senators stand out as good examples of those who understand the objectives for which their constituents elected them in representative capacities to fight for their constituency rights. These few Senators are self made and are accomplished to an extent that they do not need to steal from the public treasury to remain wealthy.
Amongst these very few individual Senators that are working assiduously to represent their constituents in an excellent way, is the former governor of Abia State- Orji Uzor Kalu who currently occupies the high profile position of chief whip of the 9th session of the senate of the federal Republic. Orji Uzor Kalu is about one amongst the very few individuals in today’s politics that was wealthy, indeed very Wealthy before stepping into the political arena. He is reputable and kindhearted.
We will peruse through his record in the senate and then assess his chances of a second coming back to the Senate as the candidate of the All Progressive Congress. Already, the PDP which is the ruling party in Abia State has nominated a failed former Senator and a paper weight to stand in as the opponent of Distinguished Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in next year’s poll. This clearly is a walk over if Senator Orji Uzor Kalu continues to work for the greatest good of his constituents as he has done in the past few Months.
But first, let us analytically peruse through the concept and essence of the constituency projects’ initiative and also read through the investigative findings of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other allied matters commission (ICPC) on the use and misuse of the constituency projects funds by the legislators currently.
The original idea of constituency projects was marred in controversy because legally, members of the legislative house are law makers and not members of the executive arm of government whose primary mandate is to build infrastructural projects all over the federation or the specific states. But this idea of constituency projects got off the drawing board because the law makers said the voters do not repose their trust on them during re-election because the voters do not understand how their elected representatives will spend four years and has no meaningful public useful projects to their names. This was how the National Assembly started the concept of constituency projects which unfortunately has suffered spectacular failure and setbacks due to corruption by the legislators.
Constituency funds, essentially, are those monies set aside or appropriated for certain projects in a particular constituent, which are more often than not nominated into the year’s appropriation by the representative of a constituent, reports Victor Agi.
Cosmas Ofoma Urama Esq writing on the constitutionality or otherwise of constituency projects sees the concept as a “developmental project sited in the constituencies of members of house of the representatives and senators by various ministries, departments and agencies of the government as appropriated in the budgets of federation or state.” To this end, the obligations of lawmakers with regard to the process of conception and implementation are simply those of nomination of such projects and oversight to ensure funds are released for their proper execution.
This intervention would leave the burden of explaining the constitutionality or otherwise of constituency projects to our “learned” friends, but to simply point out that the 1999 Constitution is clear about the roles of the executive and legislative arms of government in Section 4 and 5.
In Section 4 (1&2) of the 1999 Constitution: (1) The legislative powers of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be vested in a National Assembly for the federation which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. (2) The National Assembly shall have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the federation or any part thereof. And in Section 5 (1&2), (1) The executive powers of the federation shall be vested in the president and may be exercised by him either directly or through the vice president and ministers of the government of the federation or officers in the public service of the federation and shall extend to the execution and maintenance of this constitution, all laws made by the National Assembly and to all matters with respect to which the National Assembly has, for the time being, power to make laws.
From the foregoing extract of the law, it is unambiguous says the writer, what roles the legislatures should play with regard to the issue of constituency projects. But today, indications are that lawmakers nominate and implement constituency projects, which is clearly against the nation’s constitutional provision and the principle of separation of power as spelt out in Sections 4, 5 and 6, which defines the roles of the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary respectively.
Historically, the subject of constituency projects came into the nation’s political equation during the early years of the President Obasanjo’s administration, when legislatures voted money for certain choice projects in the appropriation bill. There were rifts between the Executive and the National Assembly, but the dispute eventually became a non-issue as the then executive cowered as it needed the legislature to equally grease its own hands on other matters, say Victor Agi.
Till date, the constituency project “arrangement” has continued and has, arguably, created more problems than the development the initiative was supposedly meant for, with budget padding and mismanagement of earmarked funds by lawmakers becoming the order, amid abuse of constitutional provisions, say Victor Agi affirmed.
But like most good ideas that ended up being misused and abused, the constituency projects have become Constituency nightmares and cashcow for some Corrupt legislators.
In August last year, the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) through its Constituency Projects Tracking Group (CPTG) initiative, recovered and sealed items worth N117m, which were stashed away in a compound in Mkpologu Town, Uzo-Nwani Local Council, believed to be owned by the senator representing Enugu North Senatorial District, Chukwuka Utazi.
The ICPC explained that the tricycles, motorcycles and grinding machines recovered were meant to be distributed in Utazi’s constituents, to empower them as part of the Federal Government’s efforts to alleviate poverty.
A statement signed by the ICPC’s spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa said, that contract for the purchase of the items was awarded on January 23, 2018, under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as part of Utazi’s constituency projects.
“The items covered by this amount (N117m) and recovered from the legislator are 168 and 51 motorcycles and tricycles respectively. They were discovered stashed away in a compound in Mkpologu town of Uzo-Nwani Local Government Area, believed to be owned by the Senator.
“Additionally, ICPC recovered 203 grinding machines, 60 motorcycles and 5 transformers in the compound which had been procured under another constituency project. Thereupon the Commission impounded all the items and sealed the senator’s compound,” the statement added.
Not long after the shock finds by the ICPC, Utazi, who was the Chairman, Senate Committee on Anti-corruption and Financial Crimes between 2015-2019 distributed the items. This development forced some constituents to accuse the ICPC of “questionably” approving Utazi to hurriedly distribute the seized items, as a way of protecting the senator. The accusation was made at an anti-corruption sensitisation programme, at Sunshine Hotel, Enugu.
A few days after, the anti-corruption agency’s drive to recover items from lawmakers, who allegedly failed to properly use funds allotted for projects, which they nominated, took them to Akwa Ibom State.
There, hospital equipment worth millions of naira, which were meant for a constituency project, were recovered from the premises of Mma Obot Foundation, allegedly owned by the former governor of Akwa Ibom State and Minster of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Obot Akpabio.
The CPTG team, according to a statement by Okoduwa, after the raid recovered a “dialysis machine; ECG monitor; oxygen regulator; anaesthetic machines; power generators, and other hospital equipment meant for a cottage hospital in Ukana, Essien Udim Local Council of Akwa Ibom State.”
She added that the ongoing project tracking exercise by the ICPC and its partners, through the CPTG, has led to multiple recoveries of items, hospital equipment, vehicles and funds, and also informed that six tractors meant for the use of farmers in six local government areas of Bauchi Central Senatorial District, were also uncovered.
The tractors recovered from a farm belonging to Isa Misau, the ICPC said, were already showing signs of wear and tear, “formed part of the N430m contract for the supply of pumping machines and other agricultural machinery to farmers in the senatorial district, which was awarded in 2015, by the Federal Government as part of the senators’ constituency projects across the nation.
“The CPTG team for Bauchi discovered that N76.6m was paid for the tractors in December 2015, but they were only supplied in March 2016… They were supposed to have been distributed for the use of farmers in each of the six local government areas in the senatorial district that included Misau, Dambam, Ningi, Warji, Darazo and Ganjuwa. It was found out that the tractors had not been distributed as required in the terms of the contract.
“In the efforts to trace the tractors, Isa Hamman Misau, the then-senator under whose auspices the project was included in the budget to be executed by the MDG (Millennium Development Goals) Office, met with officials of ICPC in Bauchi and a written statement claimed that the tractors were kept in Yuli Village.
“However, the CPTG team did not find any of the tractors there, and some of the intended beneficiaries who were interviewed claimed not to have ever seen the tractors in the village as claimed by the senator,” the agency’s spokesperson had disclosed.
The tractors, which are already showing signs of dilapidation as a result of usage, with some leaking oil, were seized by the ICPC and handed over to the Chairman, Ganjuwa Local Council for safe keep pending a full investigation.
An essayist observed that over the years, scenarios akin to the three above have routinely played out in different parts of the country, as far as Zonal Intervention Projects (ZIPs) also known as constituency projects are concerned. These glaring breaches have also succeeded in making the initiative one of the most notorious corrupt schemes since the return of democracy in 1999.
Happily, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu towers above these mundane inclinations to pilfer the resources meant for the constituency projects. Orji Uzor Kalu is only about the very few individuals in politics who deploy their legitimately generated individual resources to serve their constituents and he is somebody who for a long time has consistently piloted the idea of giving back to the society in very many generous ways.
Since he joined the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2019, numerous bills he sponsored, no doubt are clear indications of a man with the firm understanding and capacity to play for the high stakes at the highest level in our body polity, so writes an observer with considerable knowledge of the subject matter.

These salient legislative landmarks have clearly shown that Senator Orji Uzor Kalu deserves a resounding victory at next year’s poll because one quality and good term deserves a second term. Orji Uzor Kalu has not really limited his representation to his constituents but has identified himself with progressive national ideals and ideas like promotion of human rights of all, protection of the right to quality education, Women’s abd children’s rights and the right to civil rights of all Nigerians no matter their places of abode both at home and in other jurisdictions.
Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Chief Whip of the Senate says Nigerians in the diaspora will soon be able to vote from their countries of residence.
He spoke on Thursday night in Maryland when he met Nigerians living in the United States of America at the home of Hon . Emeka Eboe
Kalu said the next national assembly will fashion a way to actualise diaspora voting to accommodate millions of Nigerians living outside the country.
He said, “As a Nigerian, irrespective of where you stay or live, you should have a say in deciding who leads who. Therefore, in the nearest future, it should be possible for Nigerians in the diaspora to participate in our national elections. In 1992 as a member of House of Representatives I introduced the dual citizenship bill . By God’s grace in the 10th Senate we will introduce a bill that will allow Nigerians in diaspora to vote their choice candidate.
“We cannot ignore the millions of Nigerians across the globe making significant impact on the country’s economy and our overall development as a nation.
He emphasised the importance of effectively mobilising Nigerians in the diaspora who he described as critical components of the country’s development.
Kalu urged citizens living abroad to remain patriotic and committed to the country’s development irrespective of the current security situation.
“Continue to be patriotic here. Don’t lose hope on Nigeria; keep hope alive. We are going to overcome our challenges as a nation.
“I’m appealing to you all to always promote our country positively. Yes, we have challenges, but Nigeria is our only country. We must therefore unite irrespective of our religion, ethnicity or race,” he said.
Indeed, this Orji Uzor Kalu has paid his dues for Nigerians and deserves a beautiful re-election.
