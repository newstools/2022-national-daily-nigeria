A lawyer, Festus Ogun, had shared photos of the students on Monday on his social media pages, bashing the government of Dapo Abiodun.
On Tuesday, Ogun shared photos indicating new sets of furniture were delivered to the school.
On the latest development, Ogun said, “Commendably, Ogun State Government has swiftly provided the students of St. Kizito’s High School, Iwopin with chairs. While this intervention is laudable, I respectfully submit that the show of shame could have been avoided in the first place.”
