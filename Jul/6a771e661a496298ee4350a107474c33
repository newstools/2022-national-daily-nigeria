Mr Oreoluwa Boboye, the Chief Executive Officer of Jobberman, made this known in a statement on Thursday in Lagos.
Boboye said the new initiative was also aimed at providing an enabling environment for employers looking to give young talents a head start.
He said that the Jobberman Starter Promo was an offshoot of its ongoing partnership with Mastercard Foundation’s Young Africa Works.
Boboye said the initiative would allow companies utilise Jobberman’s job listing product for free, over the next three months for jobs that require between zero to three years of experience.
He reiterated the company’s commitment to continue to place Nigerian youths in dignified jobs as it had done over the years to bridge the gap between improving candidate uptake and facilitating entry into companies.
“The Jobberman Starter Promo is designed to attract employers interested in posting entry-level job listings on the platform by offering free credit listing for the job.
“With its partnership with Mastercard Foundation, the mission is to upskill over a million Nigerian youths, matching them with dignified job opportunities.
“We are West Africa’s number one career platform because we ensure that we connect the right candidates with the right opportunities.
“With our experience and level of expertise, we have identified the gaps in improving candidates’ uptake into companies and seek to remove the barriers and this is why we launched the Jobberman Starter Promo.
“With this, we will bridge the gap between employers in Nigeria and the entry level job seekers in the country,” he said.
