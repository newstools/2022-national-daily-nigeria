A popular chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to some incidents that occurred in the last few weeks that affect the security of the country, especially the attack on the advance convoy of President Muhammadu Buhari in Katsina State.

The former minister of culture and tourism who took to his verified Twitter handle to react to the various incidents lamented that such incidents were indefensible. He outlined some of the incidents that occurred within the last few weeks that exposed the level of insecurity in the country ranging from the attack on the President’s convoy, the attack on Kuje prison, the attack on the catholic church in Owo, the attack in Niger State and that of Zamfara State.
These security challenges that have exposed how insecure most parts of the country have become is a wake-up call to the Nigerian security agencies to put in more effort despite that they have been gallantly fighting back most of the miscreants causing mayhem within the country.
