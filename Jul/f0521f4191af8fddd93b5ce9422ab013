Suspected political thugs today, Friday July 29 invaded St Brigid Catholic in Ijesha area of Lagos, disrupting the ongoing Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC) registration exercise, chasing away people who came for the exercise.

According Princess Okogie, a member of the church, in a viral video, the thugs arrived the registration centre in the morning brandishing dangerous weapons.

“They came around 12:pm, and disrupted the registration exercise, attacking innocent people and also chased away the registration officials. They carried the registration machine away as well.

According to Princess Okogie, the hoodlums said they knew people in the area will vote for Peter Obi, hence their reasons for disrupting the exercise.

” Is this how we’re going to continue,” she lamented. “So, because they thought we are not going to vote for their candidate, they are going to disenfranchise us?
” The Police should come to our aid here, some group of people cannot disenfranchise us just because they don’t like our faces,” she added.
