Nigerians have reacted to an old tweet posted by the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai, in 2012 during Goodluck Jonathan’s regime.
This comes after the Naira crashed further against the dollar in the parallel market. The national currency, which was trading at N670 per dollar on Monday, has fallen by 6.7 percent in two days. The Naira is currently trading at N710 per US dollar.
Meanwhile, in the old tweet of El-Rufai that surfaced online, the governor can be seen questioning the higher exchange rate of the dollar against the naira.
According to him, the dollar exchange rate has moved from N140 to N160 as of January 2012, stating that Nigeria’s debt stock has doubled to higher than it was in 2005.

Netizens, however, have reacted to this old tweet by El-Rufai, citing the current exchange rate of the Naira to Dollar and how far the Naira has lost its value compared to the U.S. dollar.
Nigerians frowned at the fact that he (El-Rufai) was quick to speak on the devaluation of the Naira during Jonathan’s regime, but he has kept silence at this very point when the nation’s currency is drastically losing its value.
