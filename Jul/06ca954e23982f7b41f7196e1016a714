Speaking on Yoruba Gbode, an online radio programme, Adebanjo said only Peter Obi can rule independently among the current crop of presidential candidates.
The Afenifere leader also accused Presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu of selling Buhari to Nigerians in 2015 for his selfish interest, adding that he “will only give continuity to Buhari’s incompetence”.
He said;
“It is only Peter Obi that can rule independently without the influence of these criminals in the government. Tinubu will only give continuity to Buhari’s incompetence.
“We know Peter Obi very well , that’s why we endorsed him. He will not disappoint Nigerians, let’s put tribal differences apart and vote the right leader in.
“Tinubu sold Buhari to over 200 million Nigerians for his own selfish interest of wanting to rule after Buhari. None of them loves Nigeria.
“Easterners are also Nigerians , they deserve to rule.”
