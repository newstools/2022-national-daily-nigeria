The EFCC stated this in the lead-up to the prosecution of the suspended AGF.
The 13% derivation fund is a benefit-sharing system that helps oil-bearing states get funds from the federation revenue as enshrined in section 162, sub-section 2 of the Nigerian constitution.
Reports show that the nine oil-producing states in Nigeria shared N450.60 billion from the federation account through the 13 percent derivation formula in 2021.
The states are Delta, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Rivers, Edo, Ondo, Imo, Lagos and Abia.
According to the EFCC, Idris accepted from Olusegun Akindele, a technical assistant to the AGF, the aggregate sum of N15.4bn for accelerating the payment of 13% derivation to the states between February and November 2021.
Idris is expected to appear before Justice A.O. Adeyemi Ajayi of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja on Friday July 22, 2022.
Others to be arraigned with him are Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman and Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited on a 14-count charge of stealing and criminal breach of trust to the tune of N109.5 bn.
