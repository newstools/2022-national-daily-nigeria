Oyetola lost to his rival from the PDP Ademola Adeleke on Saturday.
The three senior lawyers working on the matter include Kola Adegoke, Abiodun Layonu Bashir Ajibola, who is also the Director-General of Oyetola’s campaign.
The lawyers will also request from INEC the certified true copies of the results.
According to the lawyers, any irregularity discovered will inform the setting up of a full-fledged legal team.
The APC governor has been silent since he lost the guber election to the PDP candidate.
But President Muhamadu Buhari has congratulated Adelek on his victory.
