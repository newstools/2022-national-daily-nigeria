The Independent National Electoral Commission  has published the name and credentials of Sadiq Wali as the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kano—instead of Mohammed Abacha who won the primary.
This has led to confusion among members of the party loyal to the state executive led by Shehu Sagagi whose faction’s primary was recognized by INEC June 30..
The opposition party had two parallel primary elections, which produced the Wali and Abacha.
Kano’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Professor Riskuwa Shehu, told journalists on June 30 that the commission monitored only the primaries conducted by the Shehu Wada Sagagi-led state executive which produced Abacha as its governorship candidate.
But INEC’s state office published only  Wali’s name and that of his deputy, Yusuf Dambatta, at Kano INEC office.
Reacting to the development, the INEC Kano state Public Relations Officer, Ahmad Adam Maulud, said the commission at the state level submitted what the outcome of the primary election it monitored to the national headquarters.
