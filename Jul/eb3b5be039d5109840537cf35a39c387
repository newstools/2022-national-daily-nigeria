The Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 2 (Lagos and Ogun), Adeleke Adeyinka Bode stated this in Abeokuta on Thursday.
According to him, the policemen in these acts are the ones sabotaging the efforts of the police force to rid the nation of crimes and giving the force a bad name.
“If you (police officers) are a cultist I don’t think you should show it to people because it is wrong; and do you know why it is wrong even if you are not wicked? If you belong to a cult group, there is no way you are not going to favour a member of your cult, unless you are not a good cult member.
“In a situation where a police officer is a member of a cult group and people in the society know that he is a cultist, his activities are related to cultism, I think it is sad.
“There are some of our policemen too now that are into cybercrime, popularly known as Yahoo-Yahoo, especially policemen who find themselves in places where we have institutions of higher learning; it is very common. You (Commissioner) need to fish them out and you need to preach to them,” Adeleke said.
He warned that another #EndSARS protest may lead to the end of the police, urging his men to be more professional and civil while dealing with members of the public.
