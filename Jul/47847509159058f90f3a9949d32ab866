Senator representing Adamawa North at the senate, Elisha Abbo appears to have mocked his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, Bola Tinubu.
Abbo’s seeming mockery of Tinubu followed the defeat suffered by incumbent Governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola of the APC in the Saturday, 16th governorship election in the state.
Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was declared the winner of the governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) having scored 403,371 votes to defeat Oyetola who polled 375,027 votes.
Adeleke won in 17 local government areas while Governor Oyetola won in 13 local government areas.
Senator Abbo, who appears to have fallen out of the camp of Tinubu over the Muslim-muslim ticket of the APC for the presidential election took to his official facebook page on Sunday to react over the Osun election outcome.
In the terse post, the Adamawa senator wrote before the official announcement was made by INEC, that APC won 13 LGAs while PDP won 17 LGA with about 28,371 votes difference.
According to him, Osun is Tinubu’s ancestral home, adding that everyone should pray for the APC presidential candidate.
He wrote, “UNOFFICIAL: APC WON 13 LGA & PDP WON 17 LGA. PDP WON WITH ABT 28,371 VOTES. TINUBU’s ANCESTRAL STATE IS OSUN. PRAY FOR TINUBU.”
