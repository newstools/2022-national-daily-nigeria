I do not see any significant impact that Okowa can have outside those states. Okowa will perform well in his home state, as he has established himself as the new godfather. He will also do well in Edo State because Governor Obaseki and Wike are at loggerheads. He can also make some gains in Bayelsa.
He continued, “As far as I am concerned, Okowa is an Igbo man from the South-South. Ifeanyi is an Igbo name, but he happens not to have come from the South-East. However, the South-East people will rather support Peter Obi. Okowa can have a limited impact on the ticket. At the end of the day, the candidate will essentially carry the ticket.
