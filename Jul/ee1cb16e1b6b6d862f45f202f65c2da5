The organisers of Headies Awards 2022 have disqualified singer, Habeeb Okikiola, professionally known as Portable from the list of nominees for threatening to kill his co-nominees of its 2022 edition.
The organisers in a statement made available on their social media handle on Tuesday said they have notified the Nigeria Police of Mr. Okokiola’s actions to fellow nominees.
“We demand for the immediate retraction of the video as well as a written apology to nominees in both categories and to The Headies has been made. Should Mr. Okikiola fail to meet our demands, we will not only disqualify him from participating in The Headies but also enforce the instrumentality of the law.
“The general public are hereby implored to disregard the video and stop the dissemination of the same in the public space,” The Headies noted.
