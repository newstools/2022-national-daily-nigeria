As we all know that the long awaited Osun State governorship election was held yesterday across different polling units in the state as incumbent governor, Oyetola went toe-to-toe against Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, amongst many other governorship candidates.
Following the Osun State governorship election, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has formally declared Ademola Adeleke, the governorship candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as the winner of the governorship election held in Osun State. According to the INEC Chief Returning Officer for Osun State, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, who announced the result on Sunday morning, said the PDP candidate scored over 403,371 votes to emerge winner.
Reacting to this information, Eniola Akinkuotu took to his official Twitter page to recall a statement issued by the vice president and former Attorney General of Lagos State, Oluyemi Oluleke Osinbajo in 2018 when Ademola Adeleke was defeated.
In the year 2018 when Ademola Adeleke lost the Osun State governorship election, the vice president, Oluyemi Oluleke Osinbajo mocked him, saying that a dancer almost became the governor of Osun State.
Reacting to this statement, Eniola Akinkuotu made it known that the tables have turned, adding that after Ademola Adeleke’s controversial defeat in 2018, Osinbajo mocked him, saying that a dancer almost became governor, but today, those that gathered are having internal frictions as Ademola Adeleke laughed last.
