A renowned female human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, has slammed the federal government over recurring kidnaping of school children from their schools. She decried that a parent would drop her/his child at school in the morning, take photographs, and say goodbye but be told later in the day that the child has been kidnapped. Expressing the agony of losing a child to kidnappers, the female activist decried that the government cannot even protect the children from being kidnapped nor rescue the victims.
Yesufu on her verified twitter handle Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu lamented: “How can you drop your child at school. Take picture of her smiling face as you are about to leave, then, the next thing you hear is that she has been abducted by terrorists. “Worse is that the government does nothing to rescue her. Kai.”
She berated the government over the kidnapped of Farida Sari at Yawuri Secondary School, Kebbi, Kebbi State, one year ago, who is still in the captivity of the kidnappers, and that is assuming that she is still alive.
