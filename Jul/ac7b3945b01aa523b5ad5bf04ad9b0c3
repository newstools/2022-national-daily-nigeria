Speaking on AIT News, Shaibu analyzed how the clerics were dressed in comparison to the practice of the Catholic church.

Addressing the topic, Shaibu said, “There was a “show of shame” where 30 characters were assembled as bishops at the unveiling ceremony of the APC vice presidential candidate. It is unusual to find bishops in Nigeria lifting chairs on their own at any political event. I tread meticulously on matters regarding the body of Christ so as to avoid spiritual jabs. They know that they lied through their teeth. “View pictures in App save up to 80% data.

He continued, “They do not even know how bishops dress. I belong to the Catholic church in particular. We know our priests. There are parts of a bishop’s dress in the Catholic church that they do not wear in public places except when they are before the blessed sacrament. When such attire is worn in public places and we see someone supposedly canonized as a Catholic priest lifting a chair to sit down, we should know that there is more to it. We do not need a clairvoyant to guess what may have ensued. May God forgive them.
