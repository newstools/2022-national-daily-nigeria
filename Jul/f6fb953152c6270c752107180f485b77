Tens of people could be seen gathered around a Hiace bus in one of the videos after it crashed into a gutter, where the bodies of the victims were apparently discovered. 

The individuals at the footage could be heard wailing and demanding retribution, threatening to kill the relatives of the Ebube-Agu Security group allegedly involved in the killings.
