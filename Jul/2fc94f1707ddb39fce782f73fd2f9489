Goodwill messages are still trooping in for the Peoples Democratic Party’s Osun State gubernatorial candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, after he defeated the incumbent Governor of Osun State and gubernatorial candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adegboyega Oyetola in the July 16 Osun State gubernatorial election.
In an exclusive interview with Channels Television on Monday, 18th of July, 2022, Senator Ademola Adeleke was asked if the immediate past Governor of Osun State and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbseola helped him to emerge victorious at the Osun State gubernatorial election.
Senator Ademola Adeleke replied that he never worked with or spoke to Rauf Aregbseola in the build-up to the poll, but revealed some close associates of the former Osun State Governor worked to see that he defeated Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.
It is rumoured that Rauf Aregbseola and Governor Adegboyega Oyetola are not on good terms. This sparked rumours that the former Osun State Governor did not want his successor to be re-elected for a second term, so he worked with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to oust Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.
Senator Ademola Adeleke also revealed that he is not holding grudges against any of his political opponent, claiming his forthcoming government is open to working with everyone, so far it is for the benefit of Osun State.
