A couple of hours ago, Senator Shehu Sani shared a cryptic post, detailing that there are also cool and very good looking Fulani men unlike the image created in the minds of Nigerians. The popular author also shared pictures of himself and some young Fulani guys he met at Shoprite in the post which he captioned thus:
“Yesterday, I met these young Fulani guys at Shoprite. A different image from the one you hear about”.
Meanwhile, a lot of reactions trailed the Senator’s post on Facebook. In fact, a particular fan expressed that the running mate to the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed was a Fulani who the whole Nigeria loves. The fan said this, while explaining that there are also good Fulanis, both young and old with whom she was still friends with.
Shehu Sani, who tried to to correct the impression that Peter Obi’s Running Mate is a Fulani man, however, replied to the Facebook User’s comment, and told her what to do so that people don’t laugh at her post. He said thus:
Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed
“Nne Rose, try and call the people of Kaduna to tell you the ethnic group of people from Kaduna so they don’t laugh at your post”.
check out the detailed post and reactions below:

However, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed was born to the Baba-Ahmed family in Zaria, Kaduna State in 1969. He is among the thirty-three children of his father, Baba Ahmed. His father was an Arab cattle-trader from modern-day Mauritania who later became a notable professor and expert on Islamic jurisprudence. In other words, Yusuf is not a Fulani man.
More so, Kaduna State is mostly populated by Hausa, Gbagyi, Adara, Ham, Atyap, Bajjuu and Agworok ethnic communities.
