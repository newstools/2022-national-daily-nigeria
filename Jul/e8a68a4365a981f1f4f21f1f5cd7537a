Adebanjo stated, “Only Peter Obi can rule independently without the influence of these crooks in the administration,” in an interview with the online radio program Yoruba Gbode.
Buhari’s incompetence won’t change under Tinubu.
We endorsed Peter Obi because we knew him well.
Let’s put ethnic differences aside and elect the right leader; he won’t let Nigerians down.
Adebanjo remarked in a Wednesday interview with our correspondent about his backing for Obi, “Am I not the first to suggest that for equity and justice and for peace, it’s the Southeast?
Obi is the only contender from the Southeast that I am aware of, and I have spoken very specifically about Obi.
