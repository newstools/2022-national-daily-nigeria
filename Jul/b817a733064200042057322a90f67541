The abductors of the Kaduna-Abuja train passengers have released another video where they sell off some of the remaining Kaduna-Abuja train passengers in their custody if the federal government failed to meet their demands.



The terrorists had attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, killing eight and kidnapping no fewer than 61 passengers.

The Managing Director of the Bank of the Agriculture, Alwan Hassan, was the first to be released after reportedly paying a N100 million ransom on April 7.

75 days after the incidents, the terrorists released 11 persons held in captivity which according to Tukur Mamu, the negotiator and media consultant to the Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, described as was achieved “following a series of robust engagement with the terrorists and with the approval of the Federal Government.”

However, on July 9, seven of the victims were later released after reportedly paying N800 million ransom.

The remaining 43 victims were told to pay N100 million to secure the release of their loved ones.

In the two minutes, 50 seconds video, the male victims were crying as they were being flogged by the terrorists.

One of the victims, a male said the terrorists don’t plan to keep them hostage for more than a week, except for the laxity of the Federal Government in paying up the demanded ransom.

He also called on the international community and the United Nations to come to their rescue as the Nigerian government was not showing any interest in setting them free.


One of the terrorists in the video vowed to abduct President Muhammadu Buhari, Kaduna State Governor, Nasiru El-Rufai and other prominent Nigerians and destabilise the country if their demands were not met.
