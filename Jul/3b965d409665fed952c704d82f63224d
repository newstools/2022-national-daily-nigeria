The singer insisted he was only doing his job—paid for.
In a video posted on Wednesday, he also asked Nigerians to vote for Tinubu in the 2023 presidential election.
This was then followed by another video where he explained was once paid to insult Tinubu, and he did.
“If they pay you money, you have to work. I was once paid to insult Tinubu during the protests. That was a long time ago. Now, APC has said Akoi Tinubu.”
“If they pay you, do your job, no ripping. When I was asked to insult Tinubu, I collected my money and did my job. Now Tinubu is the next. They’re the ones that gave me money, and I must do the work for the money I collected. Akoi APC.”
