President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday expressed regret over the demise of former Deputy National Woman Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Kemi Nelson, who dies on Sunday at the age of 66 years.
President Buhari in a statement in Abuja eulogized Kemi Nelson as a “consistent and faithful party member who devoted so much to the evolution, development, sustenance and relevance of the party in Lagos and around the country.”
The president acknowledged her contributions when she was Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in Lagos State, State Women Leader, National Deputy Women Leader of APC, and Executive Director of the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund. He observed that she was such a grassroots mobiliser and an achiever who left her footprints wherever she served.
President Buhari prayed that Almighty God will grant the husband, Adeyemi Nelson, and the family, friends and associates of the deceased, the fortitude to bear the loss and repose her soul.
