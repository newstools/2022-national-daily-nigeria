US-based dancer and musician, Korra Obidi has shared a vile message she received from a racist who terribly lambasted her and her children.
The Delta-born entertainer took to her Instagram story to share the cruel piece. The racist left ugly remarks about the mother of two by body/slut-shaming her.
In the message, the racist who referred to Korra as a ‘black whore’ and her children as ‘ugly africans’ accused her of trying to win her estranged husband, Justin Dean back with ‘fashion’ but that he has realised that she is not his type.
Talking about her children, the racist accused her of putting her ‘dirty fat baby’ on a diet so that she can look like her father.
The racist went on to further cuss her out with several abusive words, describing her ‘a black dog whose ass sinks from the men she has slept with’.
According to the note, Justin Dean who is her ex-husband left her because he realized she was not his type.
Korra Obidi who confirmed that she gets such messages on daily basis asked people if they still want to get famous.
“I get this everyday from racists. Are you sure you still want to be famous, she wrote”
