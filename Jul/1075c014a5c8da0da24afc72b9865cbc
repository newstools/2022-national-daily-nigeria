“I quit finally! Going on IG Live now to explain why! So sad but I have no other choice than to resign! Love y’all”
Many Nigerians who saw the post on social media storm the comments section to share their opinions. Out of people’s comments on Facebook, Read three comments from different three different people.
1. “I wasn’t comfortable with your decision to quit, but after you called me yesterday and explained everything to me. I saw your points”
2. “Please stop disturbing us with quit all the time. If u and your twin brother cannot do collaboration in music again so be it… Even the Holy Bible told us that they is time for everything. Psquare time has come and gone. I will advise the two of you to go into Nollywood cos your music can not sell in the market as individuals. Davido and co owns the market for now. Good luck”
3. “The truth is many at times in our head…we believe people want to know and must know everything we do or decisions we make in our personal space , but that’s not true. There are public figures out there who do their thing with no explanation. If you don’t tell people , they won’t know. Except it has something to do with people and not your private life. But , I hope you are not quitting from supporting Obi, music or life shaaa. Just do your thing…if it is something serious you are passing through in life, talk to someone. Life can only get better”
