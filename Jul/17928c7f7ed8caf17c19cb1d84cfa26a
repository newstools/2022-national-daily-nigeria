Senior Pastor, Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Dr Paul Enenche says God called him into his ministry in Plateau.

Enenche made the disclosure on Thursday in Jos when he arrived for a 3-day crusade with the theme; ‘The Lord Reigneth’.

“My calling was at Gana Ropp in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau where I went to pray.

“God gave me the direction for the ministry here in Plateau and if time permits, I will visit the place and other places before I leave,” he said.

The excited cleric who described Plateau as his home, said that Jos is like Bethel  for his family.

He said that he did his medical school in Jos, got married to his wife and gave birth to their first child in Jos.

Enenche stated that his mission to Plateau was to pray for the liberation of the State from the devil’s grip.

“We will pray for the dismantling of the principalities in the territory and for every darkness responsible for the destruction called violence.

“By the authority of the Lord, we will destroy the devil and establish the dominion and rulership of Jesus Christ over the territory,” he said.

According to him, they would also pray for enduring peace in Plateau and Nigeria.
