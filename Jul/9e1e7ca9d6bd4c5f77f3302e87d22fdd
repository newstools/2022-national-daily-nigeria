Zenith Bank Plc has retained its position as Nigeria’s number one bank for the thirteenth time in a row, according to the 2022 top 1000 World Banks Ranking published by The Banker Magazine.
The ranking, which was published in the July 2022 edition of The Banker Magazine of the Financial Times Group, United Kingdom, was based on the 2021 year-end Tier-1 capital of banks globally.
Zenith Bank’s financial performance for the year was underpinned by double-digit growth of 10% in gross earnings, with an improved market share in both retail and corporate sectors despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Commenting on the 2022 Top 1000 World Banks Ranking, the Group Managing Director/CEO of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said the ranking is a testament to the bank’s resilience and doggedness as an institution despite economic headwinds and a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment.
