On Saturday while featuring as a guest on a popular radio programme on Eagles 7 Sports in Abeokuta, former Nigerian president Chief Olusegun Obasanjo urged the youths in the country to take the mantle of leadership now, stating that they should not allow anyone to tell them the old slogan that they are leaders of tomorrow.

According to the former president, some leaders in the country would not hesitate to destroy the so-called tomorrow for them should the youths fail to take charge and take their future in their hands now.
Chief Obasanjo advised the youths that should not wait for tomorrow to take up the leadership of the country because that tomorrow may not come, adding that it the time is ripe for them to get up and make thing happen now.
Commenting on the statement by Chief Obasanjo to the youths, veteran journalist stated that he could not but agree with the former president because the young people have long been deceived by the political class into believing that they are truly the leaders of tomorrow.
According to Babajide, nobody will challenge the political class if they have been ruling well but their poor leadership, as well as the old age of the political class, are the brain behind Nigerians challenging them.
The journalist stated that the Nigerian political class is full of people who ought to have left the stage for the younger generations or have been in jail by now, but they are still holding unto power, and have refused to allow the younger generations to take over from them.
He finally interpreted the message of the former president to the youths to mean that they should join mainstream politics instead of being apolitical.
