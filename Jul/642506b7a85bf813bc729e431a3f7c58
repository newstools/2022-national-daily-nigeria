So in this article in line with a publication on Cleveland Clinic, we are going to have a look at some of the reasons why younger people suffer a stroke or may suffer a stroke. Just sit tight and enjoy this article while learning something new.
What Are The Reasons Why Younger People Suffer Stroke?
1. Smoking – this is one of the poor habits that are capable of causing a stroke. If you are the type of person that’s always smoking, it is pertinent for you to know that stroke is not limited to older adults, it could also come knocking as long as you keep smoking.
2. Use of illicit drugs heavily may also put a younger person at risk of stroke. Illegal drugs not only raise your risk of stroke but also put you at risk of numerous Cardiovascular issues; some of which may cause untimely death if care is not taken.
3. Diabetes – uncontrolled diabetes either type 1 or type 2 can cause stroke in younger people. In this case younger could mean people who are not yet up to 50. If you have diabetes or sugar concerns, then there is a need for you to look for ways to regulate sugar to avoid suffering a sudden stroke or heart-related issues.
4. Heavy drinking of alcohol is another factor that is capable of causing stroke amongst younger adults. Smoking, using illicit drugs and taking alcohol all belong to the same class. As such, excessive use of alcohol can cause poor blood circulation which may metamorphose into stroke if care is not taken or regressive steps are not taken.
