Based on data from 2021, the World Bank ranked Nigeria in the top 10 nations with the worst inflation rate.
With an annual inflation rate of 16.95 percent, Nigeria came in at number eight on the list, behind countries like Sudan, Lebanon, and Zimbabwe.
The World Bank estimates that in 2021, the consumer price index, which is used to measure worldwide inflation, increased to 3.42 percent from the 1.92 percent recorded the year before, marking the rate’s highest level in nine years.

The world is currently battling with high commodity prices, leading to unprecedented inflation rates across most economies in the world, largely due to the surge in energy prices, and supply shocks amongst other factors.
