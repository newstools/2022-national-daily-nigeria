During trading, a total of 87.95 million dollars was exchanged by participants.
Naira’s good performance follows the news from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that external reserves were on the rise and almost at $40 billion.
CBN updated data as of Wednesday, 13 July, showing the reserves stood at $39.4, a massive leap from $38.4 billion it started the month.
The rise in foreign reserves will give CBN enough firepower to tackle the forex scarcity that has forced Nigerians to approach the black market.
