And it was successful.
According to his brother, Isaac and ex-aide, Lere Olayinka, it was the second surgery Fayose would have in five months.
The procedure became necessary following injuries sustained during an attack on him during the 2018 Ekiti governorship election.
Fayose reportedly had the first surgery on his neck in February 2022.
After he lost the 03 presidential ticket of his party PDP, Fayose was on tour with the flagbearer Abubakar Atiku—for reconciliation meeting.
He has since been limited in his public appearance.
