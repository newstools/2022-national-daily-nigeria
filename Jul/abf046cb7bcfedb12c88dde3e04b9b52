In a statement on Wednesday, the President, Premium Breadmakers Association of Nigeria (PBAN), Emmanuel Onuorah, said that operating a bakery in Nigeria has become near impossible as the incessant increase in the prices of baking materials and diesel rendered the industry comatose.
He added that members of his association comprising owners, managing directors and partners of premium bakeries in Nigeria are mostly running on huge losses and this is no longer sustainable.
In a move to ensure the survival of the Premium breadmaking industry in Nigeria, we have decided to embark on a withdrawal of services beginning from Thursday 21st July, 2022 for four days in the first instance and where no intervention from the government, we shall escalate the duration of the withdrawal,” Onuorah said.
