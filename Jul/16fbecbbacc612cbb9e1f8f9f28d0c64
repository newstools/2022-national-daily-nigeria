Primate Ayodele also noted that Shettima as vice president will not bring anything good to Nigeria because God is totally against the ticket.
“APC’s Muslim-Muslim ticket is an Islamic and jihadist agenda that God is against for Nigeria. This is also an attempt to silence Christians in Nigeria and it will lead to a serious religious crisis in the country. APC has committed a very big blunder, God will not support the APC for this mistake, it’s against the plan of God for the prosperity, unity, and strength of Nigeria tomorrow’’
“Senator Kashim Shettima as the vice president will not bring anything good to Nigeria, God rejects Muslim-Muslim ticket for Nigeria.’
