Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Secretary General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said Tinubu dominates the political atmosphere of the south-west by working hard.
In a statement he signed, Isiguzoro said the former Lagos State Governor introduced other tribes to mainstream politics—unlike many Igbo elites who have failed to make a positive impact on the zone like Tinubu in the South-West.
“The political misfortunes of the South-East are traced to the individualistic selfishness of desperate APC governors in the South-East and some South-East senators who are de-marketing the zone, their actions promoted the insecurity and economic challenges of the zone,’ he said..
“Ndigbo need the type of leaders like APC Presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who has worked hard for the South-West to regain control of mainstream politics. Tinubu was fair to all in Lagos as governor.
“He introduced all tribesmen in governance and empowered them, and it’s not late for South-East governors and leaders to emulate him. This is the best way to regain control of the political spectrum of the East, which is in the hands of non-state actors.”
The LP presidential candidate and Anambra’s former Gov. Peter Obi is the only politician championing the Igbo agenda in the forthcoming 2023election.
Obi had to pull out of the main opposition party PDP when he saw his chances of winning the primary were slim.
