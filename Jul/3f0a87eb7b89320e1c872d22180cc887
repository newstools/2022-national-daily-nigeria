AGN’s Director of Communications, Monalisa Chinda, made this known in a statement on Friday, July 29.
According to her, the actors were reported missing after their family members confirmed they didn’t come back from a film location at Ozalla Town, Enugu state.
“The two members were suspected of having been kidnapped, which has increased fear amongst members about the safety of actors filming in the country.
Because of this sad development, the National President of the Guild, Ejezie Emeka Rollas, has instructed all Actors to avoid going to the outskirt of cities to film except full security cover is provided to ensure their safety,” the statement read.
