A former Minster of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode has again reacted to the attack on Kuje Prison in Abuja by terrorists belonging to the ISWAP group few days ago by saying,
“Nothing reflects the degradation of the Nigerian state more than the fact that the terrorists are capable of rescuing and freeing their own from our prisons whilst the state is incapable of rescuing those that the terrorists have kidnapped. What a mess.”
Recall that Fani Kayode had earlier reacted to the attack. What he is now saying is that terrorists should not have the power to attack any prison facility and freeing the inmates while the security agencies cannot protect and rescue the kidnapped victims in Nigeria.
Two policemen have been reportedly arrested for making phone calls with escaped terrorists. The greatest threat to national security and public safety is the infiltration of our security organizations by bandits and terrorists sympathisers. Just imagine how insecurity will end anytime soon under these circumstances? Fifth columnists are even a threat to their own colleagues in uniform. Nothing compromises national security and public safety like the recruitment of criminals and terrorism sympathisers into our country organizations.
