Manchester United began their pre-season training last week without Cristiano Ronaldo as players who were on international duty in June were expected to arrive today after an extended break.
United are expected to fly out to Bangkok to begin their pre-season tour of Asia and Australia on Friday
Ronaldo and others in the group were scheduled to arrive at Carrington this morning to meet with new manager Erik ten Hag for the first time.
But the 37-year-old will not be in attendance, citing ‘family reasons’ with United granting permission for his absence.
Ronaldo who sealed a sensational return to Old Trafford last summer, 12 years after originally leaving the club for Real Madrid in 2009 was understood to pushing for a move away from Old Trafford this summer owing to United’s inability to participate in the Champions League.
While he finished as top scorer with 24 goals, United endured a miserable 2021-22 campaign where they failed to qualify for this season’s Champions League.
United’s absence from that competition is understood to be a key factor behind his request to leave the club, having also shared concerns over the club’s lack of signings this summer.
National Daily gathered that Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes has already held talks with Chelsea, meeting with the Blues’ new owner Todd Boehly to discuss the idea of a move to Stamford Bridge.
Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain were also tipped as a possible next destination for the Portuguese, but recent reports claim the Ligue 1 giants are not interested in a move.
A move to the Bundesliga or a return to the Serie A was touted for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner with Bayern Munich and Napoli respectively believed to be interested in the 37-year-old forward.
