The Westminster magistrate court in the United Kingdom has ruled that David Ukpo, a purported kidney donor for the daughter of Ike and Beatrice Ekweremadu, is not a minor.
The court gave the ruling on Thursday when Ekweremadu, a former deputy president of the senate, and Beatrice, his wife, appeared before for trial.
Ukpo admitted to the court that he is 21 years old and had been in the UK since February but only presented himself to the police in May.
The lawmaker and his wife pleaded not guilty to the charges of human trafficking and organ harvesting in the UK.

Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice were arrested by the British police on June 23 on allegations of human trafficking and organ harvesting that violate the country’s Modern Slavery Act.
The police authorities had accused the lawmaker of conspiring to bring a child to the United Kingdom for organ harvesting, saying the victim was a 15-year-old boy.
But during the first hearing of the case on Thursday, the prosecution accepted that Ukpo is 21years old and not 15 years old.
The court thereafter fixed August 4 for the next hearing.
