In an emerging report that has led to several mixed reactions, Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, a social activist, and General Secretary, Federation of Informal Workers’ Organisations of Nigeria (FIWON) has said that the Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi allegedly paid millions of naira to Aspirants and other labour Party authorities to clinch the party’s ticket. Recall that before he joined the Labour Party, he was a bonafide member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party and also their Vice Presidential Candidate in the 2019 general elections.


But due to a perceived internal gang-up ahead of the party’s primaries in June, he decided to resign and join the Labour Party which he made public on his social media handles. However, Comrade Komolafe has stated that Peter Obi is no different from Tinubu and Atiku because he allegedly paid other Aspirants who were aspiring under the Labour Party platform to step down for him so he could become the party’s flagbearer. He also noted that Peter Obi might lose next year’s election because the stakeholders of the Labour Party are only using his popularity on social media to make money rather than to build structures across the country.
This has however led to several mixed reactions among Nigerians on social media. See some of the reactions below;
