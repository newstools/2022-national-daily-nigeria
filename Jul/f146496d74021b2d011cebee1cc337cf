An angry mob on Sunday burnt three armed robbers to death in Aba Local Government Area, Abia State. The armed robbers were identified to be tormenting Point of Sale (POS) operators at Abayi, along Aba-Owerri Road in Aba.
The Police Public Relations Officer of the Abia Command, Geoffrey Ogbonna, in  a statement on Monday, acknowledged that the robbers were burnt to death on Sunday while they attempted to escape the scene of the crime, noting that the incident generated gridlock on the Osisioma axis.
The PPRO noted that “the jungle justice is preventing police authority to further probe the activities of robbery kingpin in the area, which has been terrorizing the residents; we don’t know their names, even the suspect that escaped.”
He cautioned residents of the state to eschew from taking laws into their hands, adding that the Abia State Police Command will not tolerate jungle justice in whatever guise.
The three armed robbers were burnt at different locations, one opposite UBA building, others burnt at Union Bank junction and Star Paper Mill by Kamalu Street, all along Aba/Owerri Road.
They were terrorising Afor-Ule, Umuimo and Kamalu streets in the Osisioma axis of Aba.
