As former Rivers Sen Mangus Abe left the AC to seek his fortune elsewhere, according to him, there are indications he is working with Rivers PDP Gov. Nyesom Wike to take the reins of affairs in 2023.
The state chapter of the APC revealed this Wednesday, after weeks of denial by Abe and his loyalists.
According to its Publicity Secretary, Chris Finebone, Abe is working with Wike to bungle the APC chances in the 2023 guber election.
“The culmination of their evil machinations was the exclusion of Rivers APC from the ballot in 2019.
“Evidence exists how Senator Abe and his lieutenants broke into celebration the day the Party was excluded by the court.”
Finebone said after the 2019 loss, Abe continued to receive support from outside the state and persisted in undermining Rivers APC.
He further alleged that Abe and supporters attacked and damaged the then Rivers APC Secretariat at Forces Avenue, Old GRA, Port Harcourt.
“Recently, they also hired hoodlums and attempted to destroy the present secretariat of the party.”
“Senator Abe and the few persons still with him had concluded plans to join the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on whose platform Abe will run for governor.”
Finebone said Abe’ close associates started resigning and proclaiming their APC exit on social media.
“Rivers APC considers the formal exit of Abe and his associates from the APC as good riddance. We liken it to a successful excision of a debilitating cancer from the body,” he said.
Abe in an interview on Wednesday said he is still working for the APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu.
The Rivers politician has been in a war of attrition with former Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi who leads a faction of the state APC.
