History has a way of making its Heroes. We celebrate a great man, Journalism Bulldozer, detribalised Nigerian who has empowered over 20,000 citizens and Iroko loved by all, including even his enemies. Congratulations and Happy Birthday to our Big Daddy, PRINCE NDUKA OBAIGBENA who brought positive revolution into Nigerian Media. We’re proud of our Brother, our Hero and scion of Ika Land.
Attaining 63 years in a tough terrain like Nigeria is not an easy feat. We’re aware of your positive exploits towards making Nigeria and the society a better place. These have made THISDAY and Arise News Brands special in the Journalism business in Nigeria. You came, saw and conquered and may your efforts NEVER be in vain.
Your contributions to humanity are well captured in these words of Stephen Grellet (October 28 1772 – November 16 1855), a prominent French-American:
“I shall pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any human being, let me do it now.
Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.”
God bless you Sir, IJMN, Amen.
