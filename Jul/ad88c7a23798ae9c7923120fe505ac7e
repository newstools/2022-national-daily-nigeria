When 44-year-old Olajide Adediran picked 44-year-old Funke Akindele as his running mate for the upcoming gubernatorial election in 2023, many people, including the ruling All Progressives Congress in Lagos state called him unserious.
However in an interview with Arise TV, Jandor explained why he chose the TV star as his running mate as against other politicians jostling for the position.
Jandor started by saying that one of the reasons he picked Funke is because he wants to avoid choosing someone who is unknown and follow the political path where the people can’t remember who the deputy governor is.

He then said that “I chose Funke because she will add value to my ticket, she is a Lagosian, a successful employer of labor, and age is on our side.” He also clarified that Funke is not coming in as an actress, but as a valuable person willing to serve.
Jandor said that APC who tagged them as unserious also have a Nollywood actor, Desmond Elliot, in office.
Jandor spoke about the challenges he’s been facing since he became the gubernatorial candidate of PDP, which includes the tampering of their campaign materials.
Another issue is the refund of their money by two companies they paid to help them run some campaigns for the fear of losing their licenses.
