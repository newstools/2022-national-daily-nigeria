Kwankwaso described the Borno former governor as a good man during an interview with Arise News monitored on Sunday by our correspondent.
“Shettima was my colleague as a governor during my second term. He’s a gentleman, he’s a good man. I wish him well.
“I’m so happy with that combination; my only worry is the platform ( the APC). This platform…I don’t know.
“Bola Tinubu is a strategist. I had reasons to sit with him an uncountable number of times from 1992 till date.
“I wish I will see him to ask what he’ll do differently from what the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari is doing today. That is my serious concern for him”, the ex-governor of Kano said.
The Muslim-Muslim ticket the APC is running has attracted mixed reactions across the nation.
Some believe it is the best choice; others think it is insensitive.
