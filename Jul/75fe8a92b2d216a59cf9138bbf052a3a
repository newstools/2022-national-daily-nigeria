The Biafra Nations League militants which have been reinforcing the BNL separatist agitation with arms struggle in the Peninsula and the Gulf of Guinea on the coast of the Atlantic ocean, had encroached Abana, a border community, in two speed boats on Monday morning shooting sporadically into the air. Their activities caused panic for many travelers, making most of the travelers flee for safety.
There were insinuations that the Black Marine may have been protesting the obstruction of the movement of the BNL leader, Princewill Richards, in Isiala Mbano Local Government Area, Imo State, on Sunday by a combined team of the Nigerian Army and Nigeria Police.
The Nigerian security operatives were said to have detained the BNL leader for about four hours on Sunday before they released him.  Th3e security personnel were said to have taken away Princewill’s staff which contained a sword, an eight-in-one emergency rescue torchlight, from his vehicle.
The Black Marine had last Friday bombed a military checkpoint near the border, killing two Cameroonian soldiers and capturing one gunboat of the Cameroonian army.
The Deputy National Leader of BNL, Ebute, had in a statement on Sunday warned of the dangers of arresting BNL members in Cross River State by the Nigerian security operatives.
