A former senator, socialite, and internet personality, who goes by the name Dino Melaye, took to his official Instagram page to pour out his reactions to the alleged presence of some bishops and other clerics at the unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the running mate of the All Progressive Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. While registering his opinion and observations about an alleged Catholic reverend father who wore a chasuble in the viral photo, the ex-lawmaker who represented the good people of Kogi West senatorial district stated that, “Reverend fathers do not wear cassocks outside mass service. Desperation raised to power 1000.”
