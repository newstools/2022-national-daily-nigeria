Deji Adeyanju Abuja-based human rights activist has taken to his official Facebook handle to reveal the only way Atiku Abubakar presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party can win the 2023 presidential election.
As the 2023 presidential election is fast approaching, many social commentators and political analysts have taken to their different social media handles to predict based on their analysis who they think might emerge as the winner of the 2023 presidential election.
According to Deji in his analysis he said:
Peter Obi the presidential candidate of Labour party LP cannot win;
Rabius Kwankwaso presidential candidate of the New Nigerian People’s Party NNPP cannot win;
Even his brother Omoyele Sowore presidential candidate of African Action Congress AAC cannot win;
Deji however, revealed the only way that Atiku Abubakar of the strong opposition Peoples Democratic Party PDP can win the ruling APC in 2023.
According to Deji, he stated that PDP cannot win alone and that the only way Atiku can win APC as it stands now, is If the North does another Aminu Tambuwal move.
Recall that Aminu Tambuwal was one of the front runners for the PDP presidential ticket who stepped down and asked his supporters to vote for Atiku Abubakar at the last minute during the recently concluded party’s primaries.
So what Deji is saying, in essence, is that the only way Atiku will win is, if a northern presidential candidate of another political agrees to step down and ask his supporters to vote for him(Atiku) just like Tambuwal did.
Deji speaking further added that the ruling All Progressive Congress APC will win if the opposition parties did not unite to challenge them.
