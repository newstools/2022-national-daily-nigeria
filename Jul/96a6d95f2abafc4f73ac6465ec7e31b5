Ogundoyin gave the order on Tuesday
He urged the duo to take urgent action on how to solve the problem faced by the people of the area.
“Nature was at work in my constituency. We are, however, thankful to God that it happened in the early hours of Tuesday and no life was lost.
“I have approached the State Commissioners for Works and Transport, Prof Dawud Sangodoyin and that of Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Chief Bayo Lawal and directed them to proceed on an inspection tour of the damaged bridge with a view to taking urgent action on it.
“The damage has no doubt negatively affected the movement of our people in the two towns.
“This has even affected our students who are writing their NECO and WAEC as it is now virtually impossible to cross the stream,” he said.
