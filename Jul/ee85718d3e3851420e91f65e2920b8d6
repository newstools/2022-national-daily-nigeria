He said this in a recent chat with Chude Jideonwo, on his #WithChude Talk Show.
Asked whether he feels uncomfortable with the ‘sacrifice’ memes, the actor, who recently turned 60 said, “No, they don’t make me uncomfortable. What I found out along the line is I have done ‘Lion Heart’, I did ‘Professor Johnbull’; just name it! ‘UpNorth’, and so on and they had nothing to do with going to do juju and all that stuff. Because the actor has to be flexible.
“If they try you in this role as a presenter, the next one they should give you a mechanic. How well have you performed in that mechanic role is what should concern your audience.
“And I think it’s only in Nigeria – not even Africa that this type of casting is an issue. If you look at Sylvester Stallone, he would always be the bad guy. Look at Arnold Schwarzeneggar. That’s what it is. They don’t see it as type cast.
“They look at the flexibility of the actor in that role he’s playing and not about you did a hard guy here and there. That’s how Nigerians qualify you and that’s not good for those of us in the profession.
“So for their Oscars and so on, they look at you from the role you played and not whether it’s the same thing with the other role you played.”
