There was relative respite for former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, and his wife, Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, after the kidney donor, Ukpo David Nwamini, admitted that he is 21 years old and not 15 years as earlier claimed. The confession and acknowledgement of the real age by the court, clears one of the charges against the Ekweremadu and the wife that the Donor is a minor.
The Westminster Magistrates Court, at the resumption of proceedings on Thursday, however, remanded the Nigerian senator and his wife in prison custody, while adjourning the case to august 4.
Counsel to Ike Ekweremadu, Gavin Irwin, and the counsel to the wife, Szilvia Booker, had argued before the Westminster Magistrates Court that there was no form of exploitation or an intent to exploit Ukpo.
Nigerian delegation to the Westminster Magistrates Court to witness the Thursday proceedings include former Senate Minority Leader, Eyinnanya Abaribe; former President of the Senate, David Mark; former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; and Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Adamu Bulkachuwa.
A social commentator, Reno Omokri, had stated that he does not see the suit against Ekweremadu ending in conviction.
