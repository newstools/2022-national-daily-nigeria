According to him, unless Nigeria is restructured by the instrumentality of an Interim Government, which will establish a proper geopolitical balance within the context of a true Federalism and rectify aberrations in the polity since 1960, the next election will merely be a shadow chasing exercise.
“Nigeria is in dire need of restructuring. Our Federalism is simply terminological inexactitude. It is a realistic piece of fakery. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is obsolete, retrogressive and subversive to the Nigerian cause. It can no longer subsist as the legal protocol that guarantees the peaceful co-existence of autonomous ethnicities.
“No extant or subsisting government can right these aberrations for obvious parochial party considerations and entrenched partisan rivalries within the polity.
“The concentric arrangement of the WAZOBIA alliances have been a disaster, engendering the marginalisation of the smaller ethnic units. Thus, perforating the canopy of the Federalism under whose aegis we co-exist”.
The cleric has been in and out of the presidential race for about two decades thogh he is not running tis time around.
