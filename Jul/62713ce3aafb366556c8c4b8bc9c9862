Chelsea have finally completed a £45million deal to bring their major transfer target and England star Raheem Sterling to Stamford Bridge from Manchester City.
The former Liverpool ace winger has played a pivotal role at Etihad to see City winning the league in four of the last five seasons but he is looking for more regular starts ahead of the Qatar World Cup later this year.
National Daily understands that the deal will see Sterling overtake Chelsea’s midfield maestro N’Golo Kante as the top earner at Stamford Bridge, with the 27-year-old star reportedly agreeing terms on a £300,000-a-week contract
The former Liverpool winger was understood to have attracted interests from some top European clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, but the Blues  have now finally won the race for his signature.
Sterling becomes the first major signing under the club’s new owners
Sterling is said to have been impressed by the vision of Thomas Tuchel and the German coach’s role for him as he becomes the first major signing under the club’s new owners, the consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly.
Also on the agenda for the Blues in the summer transfer window is two new defenders to replace Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen, who both left on free transfers.
Matthijs de Ligt of Juventus has been strongly linked with a switch to Stamford Bridge, although recent reports have indicated the defender has verbally agreed to join Bayern Munich.
