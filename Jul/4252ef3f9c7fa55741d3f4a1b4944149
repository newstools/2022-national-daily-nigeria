Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has taken to his verified Facebook page to slam supporters of the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi after hinting that they are behind the petition to ban a former presidential aide, Reno Omokri from Twitter.
You may recall that Reno Omokri criticized Peter Obi over the statements that he made during his interview with Arise TV. This isn’t the first time that Omokri used his Twitter page to call out Peter Obi and his supporters. He has done it several times and it appears that some social media users want him out of Twitter.
A petition to ban him from the micro-blogging platform has now gotten over 50,000 signatures from Nigerians at the time of writing this report. Deji Adeyanju was displeased with the petition and he stated that Peter Obi’s supporters are worse that the major political parties they criticize.
In a post on Facebook, Adeyanju claimed that Obi’s supporters are behaving like ‘social media bandits’ and they hate criticism or scrutiny of any kind. He stated that the LP presidential candidate doesn’t stand a 5% chance of winning the 2023 presidential election, adding that his supporters should stop demarketing him on social media.
