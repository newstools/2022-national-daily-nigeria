Senator Shehu Sani, a former member from Kaduna Central, criticized President Muhammadu Buhari for saying recently that he was eager to finish his term and leave office.
On Monday, President Buhari was quoted as saying that the job has been challenging and he is eager to leave.
The North-West, according to the president, has presented additional difficulties, while considerable progress has been made in the North-East and South-South.
He made his position clear on Monday in Daura, Katsina State, when he hosted lawmakers, political figures, and certain All Progressives Congress (APC) governors at his home.
In a statement by Garba Shehu, his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Buhari urged some South-South natives to quit harming national assets because doing so also affects their way of life.

“I am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making,” he added.

In response to the statement, Sani suggested on Twitter on Tuesday morning that Buhari had anticipated doing miracles while in government but is now eager to leave because reality has set in.

Buhari “came in to perform magic and is now running from juju,” the author claimed. “Buhari was eager to be president and is now keen to leave the presidency.”
