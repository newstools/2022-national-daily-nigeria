Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has again called on his supporters to dial down their internet war with other presidential candidates who attack him.
The former Anambra State Governor made this appeal via his official Twitter page on Monday.
“I most sincerely appreciate all my supporters and those of LP. I love you all,” he tweeted.
“I wish to appeal to you to allow me to personally respond to any candidate that makes comments about me, while you concentrate on issues to promote our cause of moving our dear Nigeria from consumption to production, create jobs, and generally evolve a better Nigeria – PO.”
This is umpteenth time Obi will make the appeal to his followers who brand themselves Obidients and their culture of aggression online.
