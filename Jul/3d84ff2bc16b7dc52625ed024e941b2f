A report even confirmed the former SGF didn’t kick against the committee final report, but carried it to Tinubu in London weeks ago.
“I chaired the Bola Tinubu Planning and Strategy Committee, which was set up to implement strategies for Tinubu to pick the ticket,” Babachir told the Daily Trust.
And a sub-committee which Sen. Grace Folasade Bent chaired carried out its duty as Babachir appointed.
“I’m not aware of the sub-committee that recommended running mates,” he told the newspaper.
“It is not our work. You know politicians can cook up anything,” he said even when he couriered the report to London. He was the one who submitted it to President Muhammadu Buhari, too.
He then returned, and descended on his ally and party’s candidate in an article he published on Tuesday.
Babachir, in his slashing article where he insisted Tinubu and Shettima are carrying out Islamisation agenda, didn’t mention his role in the choice and presentation of the candidate and committee report to Tinubu.
Shettima was chose from among 11 candidates, including: Kashim Imam; Borno Gov. Babagana Zulum; former Speaker Yakubu Dogara; Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina J. Mohammed, Ambassador Fatima Balla and Senator Anthony Manzo.In the North West, the committee recommended Hajiya Najatu Mohammed, Kaduna State governor, Nasiru El-Rufai, a former governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, and the Kebbi State governor, Atiku Bagudu.
The APC as however indicated their decision on Shettima, a Muslim,  is final.
