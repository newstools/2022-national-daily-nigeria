It was gathered that the suspect att@ked Gift Oloku, 22, with a machete after she mistakenly broke his IPhone 11 pro max during a brawl on Saturday, July 16, 2022.
The command’s spokesperson, Bright Edafe, in a statement on Sunday, said trouble started after the suspect confronted the deceased for going out without telling him.
He was said to have accused her of infid€lity, which led to an altercation, and in the process, she mistakenly broke his phone. The suspect, thereafter, was said to have allegedly hacked the deceased to de@th with a machete.
“People said he was high that he didn’t do it with his clear eyes because he didn’t run away after k#lling her, instead, he rushed her to a general hospital.
The girl is a student of the Ozoro polytechnic, but the guy is not. Maybe he has graduated. The guy must have been on drugs last night, it was this morning that he regained himself and rushed the girl to the hospital,” a source told The Nation.
