The Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt on Wednesday ordered leading entertainment company, MultiChoice, to sub-license some channels to Metro-digital, pursuant to the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission’s code.
When the appellant (Metro-digital) demonstrated there was a dispute between itself and the first respondent, the lower court erred in dismissing the claim, according to Justice Olabode Adegbehingbe’s ruling (MultiChoice).
NBC, the second respondent, was likewise urged by Justice Adegbehingbe to compel Multi-Choice to comply with the court order within 21 days.
