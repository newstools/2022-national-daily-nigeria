Yoruba actress, Victoria Ajibola aka Omolocal has berated the United Bank for Africa (UBA) over authorised withdrawal of over N1 million from her account with the bank.
In a video she made inside one of the branches of the bank, Ajibola disclosed that the money was siphoned through a Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal within a 30-minute interval.
She expressed shock that such an amount could be withdrawn from her account which had a daily POS transaction limit of N150,000.
She said that instead of providing information that could lead to the recovery of the funds, bank officials said they could not do anything about it.
The actress explained that the bank called a policeman to arrest her for causing a scene.
Ajibola advised the bank to refund her money.
