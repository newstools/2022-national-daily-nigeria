Adeyanju recently announced he was no longer rooting for the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Obi because he is no saint—and that the former governor confessd he invested Anambra monies into his family business.
In a statement on Tuesday, a journalist who claimed he was at the meeting, Ike Abonyi, said Adeyanju lied.
Accirding to him, he was sad joining issues with a friend, but he “cannot keep mum and allow untruths to thrive”.
“I was at the meeting Deji had with Obi, I was there all through and left with him after about three hours of frank discussion.
“Obi was telling his life story in and out of government, none of which is new as he had said similar things repeatedly in public.
“Deji, did you and Obi meet again? I am shocked, you are free to support whoever without all these funny blackmails.”
He advised Adeyanju to feel free to support anybody playing any prank.
