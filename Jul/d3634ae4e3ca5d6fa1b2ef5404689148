A few hours ago, a former Spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page and reacted after Fani-Kayode’s ex-wife, Queen Precious Chikwendu reunites with him.
Remember that in 2020, Queen Precious Chikwendu was said to have separated from Fani-Kayode after she had given birth to four children. Ms. Precious who was also said to have petitioned the United Nations (UN), Amnesty International (AI), United Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), seeking justice and custody of her children, finally gained access to her children after reuniting with Fani-Kayode. The reconciliation of Fani-Kayode and Precious Chikwendu, however, got the attention of Joe Igbokwe as he affirmed that there is finally peace in Fani-Kayode’s home.
Reacting, Joe Igbokwe who seems excited about the news, shared a photo of Fani-Kayode and his ex-wife, Precious Chikwendu via his official Facebook page as he noted that peace has finally returned to Fani-Kayode’s home which is the best way forward.
