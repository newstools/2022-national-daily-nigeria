President Muhammadu Buhari has given two weeks ultimatum to the education minister, Adamu Adamu, to resolve the over five months strike embarked upon by the university lecturers.
Buhari gave the directive, Tuesday, after receiving briefings from concerned agencies, ministries and departments involved in resolving the disagreement between the striking unions and the government.
The President also directed the minister of labour and employment, Chris Ngige, to be in every meeting in order to resolve the crisis.
Also included in the team is the secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha.

ASUU had since Feb. 14 embarked on an indefinite strike over a face-off with the government.
The union had accused the government of failing to implement the Memorandum of Understanding and Memorandum of Action signed between both parties.
Other issues include the government’s poor commitment to the payment of academic earned allowances and the continued use of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System.
The lecturers are also unhappy with the refusal of the government to adopt the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution, and the proliferation of universities in the country.
