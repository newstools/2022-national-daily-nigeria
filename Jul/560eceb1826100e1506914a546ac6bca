Tinubu was quickly flown to France for what his aides call an important meeting. After the news went round, Wike’s aide also released the picture of his boss vacationing in Turkey.
But Igbokwe added a new dimension.
“While they are on social media abusing everybody, Governor Wike goes to France to meet Asiwaju. Abuse, calling names, hate, and bigotry are no strategy. They hated and abused PMB (President Muhammadu Buhari) since 2015 and now they have transferred the aggression to Asiwaju. We wait and see,” he wrote.
Many doubted him on social media, asking for evidence.
Considering Igbokwe status in the APC politics in Lagos, some would believe he wasn’t unhinged writing that.
In addition, Wike has been offish to his party and presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar since he lost the ticket and even the V.P. slot which many believed he deserved to get.
There have been reports the Rivers governor and his supporters are pulling out of the PDP to join the APC or the LP party.
It was Ebonyi Gov Dave Umahi who first courted Wike since the PDP rejected him. NNPP’s Rabiu Kwakwanso and LP’s Peter Obi have also visited him.
As many political observers were about to believe the Wike-Tinubu France meeting, Igbokwe  deleted the post Thursday night.
