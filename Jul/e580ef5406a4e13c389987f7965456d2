It’s no longer news that Lukaku who cost Chelsea £100M to sign in 2021 has left his former club inter, on loan, the transfer deal is said to be around £10M. Chelsea signed the Belgium star man so he could solve the issue the team where faced with in the 2020/2021 season, that is goal scoring. But instead, Lukaku made the team worst and that is why Chelsea decided to loan him back to Inter, although there is talk of him coming back if he doesn’t impress at Inter Millan.
Following the completion of Lukaku’s move to Inter Millan, the star shared an eye-catching post on Instagram which triggered a lot of Chelsea fans.
Romelu Lukaku uploaded a picture of himself on his Instagram, and captioned the post with a quote from Moneybagg Yo​’s song ‘Scorpio’ the quote says: ​”I’ma probably show you I’m solid first and if the energy ain’t right. “I’ma show you how easy it is to cut ties, no more tries. Gone…”Chelsea fans were quick to share the post on a Chelsea community page on Twitter as they believe the caption on the post has more meaning to it. Chelsea fans interpreted the Instagram post caption as a dig at his failed second spell at Stamford Bridge.
Here are screenshots of some fan’s reactions to the post above:-
