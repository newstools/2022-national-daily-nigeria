Nigerians on Twitter have stated that the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, will be the next governor to rule a state for just one-term.
This is as the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, lost the election to the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, in the election held on Saturday.
Oyetola, who came into power in 2018, polled 375,027 votes against Adeleke, who had 403,371 votes in the just-concluded election.
Adeleke had won the Osun State elections in 2018 against Oyetola but following a rerun of the elections, Oyetola was declared winner.
Despite protesting his loss at a tribunal, Oyetola was still upheld as the winner with a margin of less than 500 votes.
Just like Oyetola, Uzodimma was declared governor of Imo in 2020 by the Supreme court despite coming fourth in the 2019 state election.
According to some Nigerians on twitter, Uzodimma of the All Progressives Congress, will be voted out in the coming election in Imo State.



Hope Uzodinma is next to join Oyetola as a one-term Governor.
Every stolen mandate the people shall reclaim.
There is hope for ndi Imo state.

Hope Uzodinma I believed you watched what has happened in Osun state. Get ready to be served hot breakfast by Imolites.

Governors in some states should be very worried. Hope Uzodinma being chief among them – there no way that one will be re-elected.
