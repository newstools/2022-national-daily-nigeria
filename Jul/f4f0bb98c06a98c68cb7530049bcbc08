The criminals also boasted that they would destroy the country, kill the remaining passengers held hostage and traffic others.
Some passengers were released recently after paying ransom.
One of the terrorists threatened that unless the government comply with their demands, they would turn the area into an abattoir.
“This is our message to the government of Nigeria and just as you have seen these people here, by God’s grace, you will see your leaders; your senators and governors will come before us. These ones you are seeing here, we will keep some as our slaves and sell them off just as our Imam told you in the past,” he said.
“He further stated in Hausa: “Just like the Chibok girls that were sold off, we will equally sell these ones as slaves. If you don’t adhere to our demands, we will kill the ones we need to kill and sell the remaining. By God’s grace, El-Rufai, Buhari, we will bring you here.”
Buhari’s entourage was recently attacked by terrorists as the president’s advanced security team ran into an ambush on their way to Daura, Katsina.
