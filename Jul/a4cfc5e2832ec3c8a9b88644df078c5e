The deputy governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Funke Akindele, has set the ball rolling on the drive to displace the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state in 2023. She was of the view that residents of Lagos State want the APC out of government because people want to right the wrongs, thus, people need the PDP to take over the government of the state.
Funke, running mate to Olajide Adediran, Jandor, expressed her passion to improve humanity, saying that the time has come to be part of the system and end the talking, noting that the PDP has the structure to win elections.
She had stated: “You need a party with a structure if you want to win, a viable party and you need PDP to take over.
‘I am very compassionate about people, people working with me, children. I have faced different challenges as a Lagosian and I looked at it; are we going to continue like this? No, I am tired of talking, let us do something about it.
“I will like to do this on a big scale, I will like to better the lives of Lagosians and when this opportunity came, I jumped at it.
“I live in Lagos, I do not like the way we live in Lagos, and the standard of living is pretty low. Lagos is suffering from infrastructural decay and deficit.”
“I am in the system I am in the pain. We all know where the shoes pinch us.”
She stated: “I have the numbers, I have fans and followers, and I am true to myself. I have close to 19-20 million followers on social media.”
