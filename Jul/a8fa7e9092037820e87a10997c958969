Former Anambra State Governor and presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has reacted to the inclusion of his campaign photo on the praying mat by his support group.
A day ago the photo of Peter Obi spotted on prayer mats had sparked reactions on social media. Many had condemned the act, and one of those who expressed concern about the issue was the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri. In a post he made on his verified Twitter handle, Reno Omokri had shared the photo and stated that Islam does not tolerate images of humans or animals in mosques. Although some people said that it can’t be said if the mats would be used in a mosque.
In his reaction to the action, Peter Obi said that even if the support group may have had good intentions, the inclusion of his photo on praying mats was misguided. He said that he has deep respect for the Muslim faith, and that he would never mock any faith, ethnicity or gender.
In the post he made on his verified Twitter handle, he wrote – “The inclusion of my picture on the praying mat by a support group was misguided, even with the best of intentions. It didn’t emanate from my campaign team. I have deep respect for the Muslim faith, and indeed for every other religion. We will never mock any faith, ethnicity or gender. We are one Nigeria.”
Many have taken to his comments section to commend him for addressing the issue, especially for something that is that sensitive.
