Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has reacted to the statement made by the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso which claims that the South-East is at the bottom line in Politics.

It should be recalled that Rabiu Kwankwaso, on Saturday revealed that the people of the South-East are only good and talented at business but in politics, they are at the bottom.
However, Reno Omokri while expressing his disappointment over Kwankwaso’s utterance towards the southeast says it’s unfortunate to use Such a statement to describe the southeast and the Igbo Origin, adding that he should reconsider his statement and Make an apology.
Reno Omokri further asserts that we are all Nigerian and no one should be regarded as a Bottom feeder, adding that his statement is nothing but Downer.
in His words”That statement credited to Rabiu Kwankwaso was not well thought out. I respect Kwankwaso, but to use such adjectives to describe the Southeast, and people of Igbo origin is rather unfortunate. I truly hope he reconsiders his statement and issues an apology. We are all Nigerians. Nobody is a bottom feeder!
Yes, he may have been the object of insults and ridicule from the supporters of a particular candidate. But he is not the only one. Both Atiku and Tinubu and their supporters have been on the receiving end for months. It comes with leadership. That statement was a downer”
