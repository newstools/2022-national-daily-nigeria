Presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has debunked reports that Governor Nyesome Wike snubbed his emissary in Turkey.

Reports had emerged that Wike refused to grant audience to a former Minister of Police Affairs, Adamu Waziri who was sent by Atiku.

It was also reported that Wike refused to speak on telephone with Atiku and his emissaries who were trying to have a meeting with him.

This comes amid speculation that Wike might be looking to dump the opposition party, after losing the PDP’s presidential ticket to Atiku Abubakar.

Atiku also snubbed Wike for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta state when he picked his running mate.

This has resulted in tension within the leading opposition party.

But, Paul Ibe, Atiku’s Senior Special Adviser on Media, denied the reports, saying the PDP Presidential candidate did not send any emissary to Turkey.

He assured that all issues with Governor Wike and other aggrieved leaders will be amicably resolved.

”The report that H.E @atiku sent an emissary who was shunned by Gov Wike is at best hogwash. The @OfficialPDPNig presidential candidate did not send any emissary to Turkey.

”Those trying to create a wedge between the leaders do not mean well for the PDP and Nigeria. I wish to assure them that all extant issues with the Rivers State Governor and other aggrieved leaders will be amicably resolved so that the party can focus on booting out the ruinous APC administration and commence the arduous task of reconstructing our nation,” he tweeted.
