Nalongo Gloria, from Uganda, was abandoned by husband Ssalongo when she delivered their ninth and tenth child. “When I got pregnant with twins on the third day, the man said this is too much for him and told me to go home.
Where he was sending me, I didn’t have their numbers anymore because I came to Kampala to work as a house girl,” a dispirited Gloria told NTV Mwasuze Mutya during an interview.
It was the beginning of a rough road for Gloria, who barely had anywhere else to seek help. Stuck in the middle of nowhere, Gloria’s lover, Ssalongo, gave him terms and conditions. “The man told me that if I can’t produce one child, he can’t take care of me with the dogs,” Gloria disclosed.
One day, when Gloria was looking for something to do, she found out her man had packed his things and left.
