According to sources,  Teeebam returned from Cairo to surprise his wife on her birthday.
But the wife was already bitter after discovering her husband has another woman and a child between them.
The confrontation escalated.
She first burned Teebam’s phone, and then doused him with fuel, setting him ablaze.
Neighbours rushed him to hospital where he died on Tuesday.
But the wife appeared adamant, considering her reaction on whatsapp.
“I’ve always been a calm girl and I have never done this in my life but Teebam has pushed me to the edge. At this point, y’all will weep over myself and him before daybreak. I’m promising y’all that,” she reportedly wrote.
She however took off, and the police is on her trail.
