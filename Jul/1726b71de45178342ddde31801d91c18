The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) says it is convinced that the attackers and those funding the sophisticated attacks in Enugu and other South-East states are members of the deep State from the federal capital territory connected to MIYETTI ALLAH CATTLE OWNERS ASSOCIATION.
HURIWA stated this in a statement on Thursday in reaction to Wednesday’s attack on INEC staff involved in the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise by yet to be identified gunmen in Community Primary School Umuopu in Umuozzi Ward 19 of Igboeze North Local Government Area of Enugu state.
National Coordinator of the group, Emmanuel Onwubiko in the statement said the aim of those promoting terror in the South-east is to destabilise the Igbo nation.

“The inability of all the security institutions based in the South-East and controlled from Abuja not to arrest and end these vicious circles of attacks means that there is more to it than the ordinary eyes can see therefore necessitating that President Muhammadu Buhari should adopt a radical decision by arresting any police commissioner, Director of DSS, and the General Officer Commanding the 82 Army Division in Enugu for alleged complicity since it is humanly impossible for such massive scales of criminality and crimes to last more than two years with no breakthrough on the side of the law enforcement agencies.
According to the group, the attacks in the North-West were remarkably different from that of the South-East because in the North-West there are known armed Fulani terrorists but in the South-East most of those terrorists are simply classified comically as unknown gunmen making it look like a huge joke whereas the attacks are deadly.
“HURIWA recalled that similar orchestrated and funded violence from external forces happened not too long ago in Imo State and Anambra State severally thus disrupting the Continuous voters registration in those key Igbo states, a decision the Rights group said was premeditated and prearranged to depopulate the voting strength of Igbo States.”
HURIWA challenged the governors and political leaders of Igbo states to wake up and take measures to stamp out this well coordinated political violence targeting Igbos.
