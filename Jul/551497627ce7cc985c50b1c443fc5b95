Again, bandits and crimnals operating in Kaduna’s countryside collided on Friday in Birnin Gwari LGA, leaving casualties on all sides.
The Anasru terrorist group were preaching to the community when bandits descended on everybody in the area, including Damari villagers.
According to eyewitnesses, Anasru has been securing villages in the area against banditry, preaching its brand of Islam, and assuring the villagers of their protection.
But the armed bandits would not cede that territory. So they launched an hour-long gunfight while the terrorists, armed too,  were preaching.
The shootout recorded casualties no doubt, but the figures on both sides could not be confirmed yet.
However, a shop, two vehicles and a private hospital were burnt. And two farmhands ran into the fleeing bandits, and were killed.
The terrorists routed the bandits, and came back to continue their preaching, adding self-defence against the bandits and the Nigerian government to their preaching.
