Omowale Owolabi, 32, Raak Sami Sadu, 32 and 33-year-old Samson Ajayi were convicted and sentenced by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Thursday, July 28.
IrishTimes reports that the trio sent around €250,000 of the victim’s money from Ireland to accounts linked to fake companies set up in Turkey and Vietnam. The gang is believed to have then used the money to buy products to ship back to Nigeria where they were sold.
The court heard that the woman met a man calling himself Neil Turner on the dating website in November 2019. The two began to message each other romantically, and more than 800 pages of messages were downloaded by gardaí
The fraudsters, using the fake profile, told the woman that Turner had business dealings with oil and gas off the coast of Cork.
