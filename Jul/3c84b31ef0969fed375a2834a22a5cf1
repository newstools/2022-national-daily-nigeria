The Federal Government on Thursday declared Monday, 11th, and Tuesday 12th, of July 2022, as public holidays to mark the Eid-el-Kabir festival next week.
The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, declaring the holidays on behalf of the Federal Government, congratulated all Muslims and Nigerians both at home and in the Diaspora.
According to the Minister, “I call on Muslims to continue to imbibe the spirit of love, peace, kindness and sacrifice, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him) and to also use the period to pray for peace, unity, prosperity and the stability of the country, considering the challenges of insecurity we face at the moment.”
The Minister assured that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is “committed to the security of lives and properties of all Nigerians, empowering the citizens for successful living, the provisions of social investments programmes and adequate security in the schools”.
Aregbesola urged Nigerians to be vigilant and observant of intruders in their communities.
“We must all take responsibility for the security of lives and property as we celebrate this year’s festival.”
He encouraged Nigerians “to come together, put heads, hearts and all we have together, in order to achieve relative peace for harmonious coexistence and put an end to insecurities in Nigeria.”
