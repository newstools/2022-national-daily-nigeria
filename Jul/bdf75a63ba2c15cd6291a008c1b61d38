A video which surfaced online captured some police officers frantically trying to find a solution after their van got stuck in Auchi, Edo State.
The policemen found themselves trapped in the middle of muddy water and were looking for ways to come out of the complex situation.
Someone moved closer to the officers like he wanted to help but he changed his mind and made a U-turn.
Residents in the area chose to make jest rather than offer assistance and at some point the officers just sat inside the car as though they have given up.
