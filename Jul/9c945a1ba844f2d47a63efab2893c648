President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the death of Ambassador Isaac Sagay, a former Nigeria’s High Commissioner to Ghana, and Ambassador to Spain, with concurrent accreditation to the Holy See, The Vatican.
Buhari said Sagay served Nigeria dutifully as a foreign officer.
In a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, the president said the deceased was a dedicated and thoughtful diplomat.
The President joined members of the Olare-Aja family of Sagay clan in mourning their father, uncle, and illustrious son who “served the nation dutifully as a Foreign Service officer reaching the pinnacle of his diplomatic career as an ambassador.”

The statement reads: “In each of his ambassadorial roles, the President notes that Ambassador Sagay was a dedicated and thoughtful diplomat who provided exemplary leadership as Head of Nigeria’s Mission of the Group of ECOWAS Consultants and Observers that diplomatically addressed the very contentious post-war presidential elections in Liberia and Sierra Leone respectively.
“The President also affirms that in his retirement from the Foreign Service, the diplomat remained relevant in national duties, serving as Delta State Commissioner at the Federal Character Commission and Pioneer Chairman of the Association of Retired Career Ambassadors of Nigeria (ARCAN).”
As Ambassador Sagay is interred on Friday, the President prayed that God should grant the soul of the departed eternal rest and comfort family, friends, associates as well as colleagues who will sorely miss him.
