The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Engr. Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, has expressed concerns over the burden of trust the All Progressives Congress (APC) lays on the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 general elections. Kwanwkaso in a media interaction expressed that if he has the opportunity to see Tinubu face to face, he will ask him what he will do differently from what President Muhammadu Buhari is doing presently.
Kwankwaso acknowledged Tinubu to be a strategist, endorsing his resolve for Muslim-Mislim presidential ticket of the APC, but expressed reservation about the ruling party.
Kwankwaso had declared: “I wish I will see him to ask what he will do differently from what Muhammadu Buhari is doing today. That is my serious concern for him.”
Kwankwaso also stated that former Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State who Tinubu on Sunday announced his running mate, is a gentleman and good man.   He commended the joint presidential ticket of Tinubu and Shettima.
Kwankwaso had stated: “Shettima was my colleague as a governor during my second term. He’s a gentleman, he’s a good man. I wish him well.
“I’m so happy with that combination; my only worry is the platform. This platform…I don’t know.
“Bola Tinubu a strategist. I had reasons to sit with him an uncountable number of times from 1992 till date.”
