The grammy-winning Nigerian singer revealed this in a chat with the hosts of Million Dollar Worth of Game podcast on Sunday.
Burna Boy faulted the general labelling of music from Africa as Afrobeats, as there are diverse sounds from the continent. He stated that the generalisation was unfair to African artistes.
He said, “We have Highlife, Juju music, Fuji music, South African Kwaeto music, Amapiano, Afropop, we have all types of genres in Africa. To be really sincere, for you to just call everything Afrobeats kind of does a disservice to the artistes.
“For me, when I started the Afrofusion thing, it was like my music was not the same with anything that was out. It was like everybody else kind of sounded the same.”
Revealing how he wanted something he could identify himself with, he said, “It was one kind of move and for me, there was nothing I could identify myself with. So I just decided that I’ll call it Afrofusion because it’s a fusion of everything. The Afro-Africaness is the thing that covers it, it’s the bottle that holds the whole drink. That is why I always make sure that everybody knows this is what I do, it’s Afrofusion.”
