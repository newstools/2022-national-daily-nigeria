President Buhari’s daughter, Nana Hadiza, and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Friday got married at the Aso Rock Villa.
The couple tied the knot in an intimate Nikkai ceremony attended by close family members and some top government officials, Blueprint gathered.
Hadiza was married to Abdulrahman Mamman Kurfi until the marriage collapsed due to irreconcilable differences.
No official statement has been issued in confirmation or denial of the reported nuptial bliss.
