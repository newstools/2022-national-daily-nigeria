Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Thursday honoured the players and managers of the state’s football team, Rivers United, in Port Harcourt, for winning the Nigerian Football League. Governor Wike hosting the team to a reception at the Government House, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, commanded the team for dedication and hard work to achieve the victory. He noted that the hard work earned them the victory and prevented manipulations that would have prevented them from becoming champions. “You know in this country, anything happens. If you did not win with wide margin, if you had won with 3 points, they probably would have told you one team has withdrawn, or two teams withdrew, and then, disqualify you. But with the wide gap, it was difficult for them to manipulate,” the governor highlighted.
Governor Wike urged the team to prepared physically and psychologically for the CAF Champions League, reminding them that they would be representing Nigeria in that competition. He also cautioned the players and the managers to be at alert over the politics in the CAF competition.
Governor Wike announced that the State government will confer the players and managers with Governors Medal Service (GMS) award. He also announced that the state government will sponsor the team to Madrid, Spain, for two weeks training and   preparations for the CAF competition. Governor Wike announced a cash reward of $20,000 to each player, promising to double  the amount if they qualify to the group stage of the CAF Champions League.
Wike assured the Rivers United that the state government would do everything humanly possible to support the team in the new season.
