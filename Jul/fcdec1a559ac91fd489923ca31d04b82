Chairman of the senate committee, Senator Gabriel Suswam (PDP, Benue), said, “Since electricity is on the concurrent list in the constitution, the bill has allowed state governments to license people who intend to operate mini-grids within the states.”
He said, “The bill also gives legal backing to renewable energy. If you decide to generate one megawatt of power using solar as an energy source, that is also provided for. “That is the only way the power problem would be solved. The space is now open; there is a little restriction as to who can generate power and distribute.
What is obtainable now is that any power that is generated must be put on the national grid for transmission and distribution.”
