The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has lamented that the frequent total collapse of the country’s National Grid has become too much for the Nigerian people to bear.
Atiku noted that the collapse of the National Grid on Wednesday was the 6th time in 2022, suggesting the need to create a conducive environment for investors to come in and stabilise the power sector.
Atiku stated: “Due to the priority that I place on the power sector upon which the successes of other sectors are hinged, I am proposing innovative financing of infrastructure that will involve the facilitation of a review of the financial, legal, and regulatory environment to promote private investment in power, among other sectors.
“I’ll promote the incentivisation, with tax breaks, a consortium of private sector institutions to establish an Infrastructure Debt Fund (IDF) to primarily mobilise domestic and international private resources for the financing and delivery of large infrastructure projects across all the sectors of the economy.
“The IDF will have an initial investment capacity of approximately US$20 billion.”
