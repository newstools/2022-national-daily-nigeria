Abdulkareem gave the assurance while fielding questions from newsmen on Monday on the potential of the N600 million mega poultry farms in Ilorin.
He commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders for their cumulative efforts that culminated in the establishment of the farm.
Abdulkareem explained that the revenue would make money available for critical aspects of the university’s operations in the areas of research and physical development.
The vice-chancellor, however, appealed to the CBN to consider a downward review of the interest rate on the loan from nine to five per cent beyond February 2023 for the business to flourish.
He assured that the farm would be properly managed to achieve its target and for the university to become a model in the running of such a commercial initiative.
Abdulkareem said that the farm, which is situated on 30-hectare land, currently houses 17,000 layers, a feed mill with an installed capacity of five tons/hour.
He added that there is also a semi-autonomous Broiler Processing Unit with a capacity to process 1,000 birds per day, among other facilities.
“The farm is expected to contribute to food security of Nigeria, bridging the wide gap between demand for poultry products and supply,” he said.
