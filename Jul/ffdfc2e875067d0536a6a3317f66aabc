A special Adviser to the Lagos State Government on gutters and drainages and ruling party All Progressives Congress chieftain, Joe Igbokwe has yet again stirred mixed reactions from people with a post made via his official Facebook page this morning.
Joe Igbokwe shared a picture of Seyi Tinubu who is a son to the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu carrying some cartons of goods and sweating profusely which he tagged as being hardworking.
The controversial political figure expressed his reactions in such a way to indicate that he is very much proud of him putting in all his best by stooping so low in that regard, not minding his father’s state of influence and affluence in the country.
As it was clearly seen, this has not been the first time Joe Igbokwe will be raining praises on him having done so on several occasions, particularly praising him for his laudable efforts put in to rally unending support for his father during the last presidential primaries of the APC where Asiwaju won the the ticket against all odds with wide margin.
His reaction therefore indicated that he likened the efforts of the son to that of the father who is also known for his political prowess coupled with his input to humanity using his elevated position.
