Manchester United who on Friday completed the signing of former Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen on a three-year deal have been battling with some uncertainty in their attack after Cristiano Ronaldo had requested a transfer thus leaving Anthony Martial as the only other option.
Though National Daily understands that United are still hoping to persuade Ronaldo to stay, but, regardless of what happens with the 37-year-old, Ten Hag is keen to bolster his strike force.
And with Ten Hag’s failure to convince Brian Brobbey against a permanent deal at his former club Ajax in a bid to bring him to Old Trafford, the Red Devils are believed to be exploring other options with The Mirror reporting that United have added Brentford attacker Ivan Toney to their list of potential targets.
A successful move for Toney will therefore see Eriksen reuniting with the 26-year-old forward reunite away from Brentford, especially after the Northampton Born England attacker who netted 12 Premier League goals and laid on five assists last season is believed to be open to leaving the west London club this summer.
However, it is left to be seen if the Bees who were unsuccessful in their attempt to convince Eriksen to extend his stay shortly before he was persuaded to move to Old Trafford by Ten Hag will allow their hitman to join the Dane at Old Trafford.
United fans will hope to see the reunion of Eriksen with Toney at Old Trafford.
National Daily meanwhile understands that Toney and Eriksen struck up a good relationship during their brief time playing together, with the pair looking particularly threatening on set-pieces and United fans will hope that their union could be extended to Old Trafford.
