Babajide, who resides at Yaba, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining by false pretences and stealing.

The prosecutor, ASP Rita Momah, told the court that the defendant committed the offences in April 2019 in Lagos State.

The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.O. Salawu, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum.
Salawu ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and reside within the court’s jurisdiction.
She added that each surety must submit his National Identification Number, six months’ bank statement of account and Lagos State Residents Registration Agency card.
