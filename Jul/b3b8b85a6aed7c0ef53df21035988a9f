Bandits appear to be winning the war in Katsina State, intensifying their onslaught on residents of Katsina State, including security operatives. Accordingly, the bandits created the phobia that compelled the Katsina Emirate Council (KEC) to cancel the Eid-ul-Adha royal exhibition festival, citing the perennial insecurity in the state.
The Katsina Emirate Council (KEC), in a statement by the Assistant Secretary, Alhaji Sule Mamman Dee, explained that the regular Hawan Daushe, announced that the usual carnival of the royal exhibition of garments and regalia that features horse riding, will not hold during the Sallah celebration on Saturday.
The emirate council disclosed that the prayer points for the Eid prayers to be led by the emir in the mosque should be focused on “all perpetrators of evil in the state and in Nigeria be exposed.”
The emirate council in the statement translated from the Hausa language, indicated: “The Emirate Council is informing the general public that by God’s grace, on Saturday 9th July, the Emir will lead the Eid prayers in the mosque.
“The council further asks ALL to pray to God to grant us peace and unity. Amen.”
