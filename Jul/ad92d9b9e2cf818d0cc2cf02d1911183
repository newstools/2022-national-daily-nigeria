The Plateau State Contributory Healthcare Management Agency (PLASCHEMA), a social health insurance scheme, has debunked a report claiming that its  Database is porous and unsecured.
The health care platform described the malicious report as the handy work of mischief makers who will stop at nothing to discredit a programme tailored to ameliorate the suffering of common citizens.
Describing the report as fake, Dr. Fabong Yildam, Director General PLASCHEMA, on Saturday addressed Journalists, saying that at no time did Website Planet notify the Agency of any bridge of beneficiaries data.
Yildam stated this while emphasizing on the clause as quoted by Website Planet claiming that it had earlier notified the Agency of their assertion.
According to Yildam: “It is important to point out that the claim by Website Planet to have discovered beneficiaries’ information in the open during their web mapping project does not hold. PLASCHEMA places a very high premium on the Data of our beneficiaries. We do not for any reason condone unwarranted access to the personal data of beneficiaries. We shall not rest until we unravel any malicious third party that is attempting to undo PLASCHEMA”, he said.
The Agency lauded its ICT experts who have continued to work round the clock ensuring that beneficiaries information is well secured.
“Since inception we have worked with the best ICT company who have ensured our systems are properly set up and our technology operations are secured, end-to-end”, PLASCHEMA said.
