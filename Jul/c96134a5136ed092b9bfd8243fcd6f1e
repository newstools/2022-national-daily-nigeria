Deputy Speaker House of Representatives Ahmed Idris Wase disclosed while contributing to the motion to halt the planned ban on the use of Motorcycles across the nation by the federal government.
The motion was presented by Abubakar Makki Yelleman (APC Jigawa) at the plenary on Tuesday.
“You can imagine what is happening today in Abuja. I will be frank with you. I went through DSS reports. 44 reports were given before the attack of Kuje. I want to say so, I want to confirm to you, 44. I went through all the reports. And it all has to do with this,” Wase said
“There is no community that one attack or the other will happen and we will not have intel, and this is part of the intel they have given as what is going happen, what is happening and what is not going to happen”.
But Wase said government should be supported to implement such moves in vulnerable communities where the ban could check banditry, terrorism and other criminalities.
The federal government has proposed a nation-wide ban on commercial motorcycling to check the growing spate of terrorism across the nation.
