The death of Ochuko Erumrejovwo aka Emperor, 24, has come as a shock to those who knew him.
It was gathered that the DELTAPOLY graduate was on Saturday, July 16, m#rdered by unknown gunmen in front of his residence at NDDC road, Sapele, Delta State.
A close source said, “Ochuko was returning from his hair salon when he was accosted by unknown gunmen who sh@t him just in front of his house.
It’s heartbreaking as Ochuko recently passed out from the NYSC scheme and his marriage to his wife isn’t up to a year. We suspect he was k#lled by those envious of his accomplishments as he has two houses and a plot of land to his credit.
