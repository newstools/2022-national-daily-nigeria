Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has said there was no meeting between him and the Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike, in France.
Tinubu had recently flown to the European nation to continue high-level engagements with stakeholders.
However, a chieftain of the APC in Lagos State, Joe Igbokwe, claimed there was a meeting between the duo.

On Friday night, the Tinubu Media Office in a statement signed by Tunde Rahman said although the APC flag bearer holds Wike in high esteem, such a meeting never took place.
Part of the statement reads: “We have seen a viral social media post made by one of the chieftains of All Progressives Congress in Lagos State and media reports emanating from same about a supposed meeting in France between APC Presidential Standard-bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and His Excellency, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.
“It has become imperative to set the record straight. Although Asiwaju Tinubu is presently in France, he didn’t have any meeting with Governor Wike whether in that country or anywhere whatsoever.
“This, however, does not detract from the fact that the APC presidential candidate holds Governor Wike in high esteem.
“And given the national and across-party lines appeal of Asiwaju Tinubu’s candidature, he will not hesitate to meet any important national leader when desirable.
“As made public earlier, Asiwaju Tinubu is in France for some important engagements. He will return to the country shortly.
“We would like, once again, to advise journalists to always cross-check their information with appropriate officers before rushing to press to avoid unintended errors.”
