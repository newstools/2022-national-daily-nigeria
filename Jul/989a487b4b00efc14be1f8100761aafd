With the 2023 presidential election just a few months away, the intrigues, plots, and subplots have continued to thicken in Nigeria’s political space.
According to reports from several media outlets, three members of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), and Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) have arrived in Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital to meet with Nyesom Wike and Ayodele Peter Fayose.
There are indications that the three governors have been sent by the leadership of the APC to capitalize on the current internal crisis brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by wooing Wike and Fayose into joining the ruling party.
As expected, this has sent the country’s political space into a frenzy as many observers have come out to share their thoughts on the development.
Taking to his Twitter handle a few minutes ago, renowned human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju expressed his amusement at the move being made by the APC to steal Wike and Fayose from the opposition.
Going further, the activist noted that he cannot disclose what the ruling party’s endgame is yet, he, however, pointed out that what the APC is working on will soon be obvious to Nigerians.

No doubt, the meeting between the APC governors and Wike will send the PDP into panic mode as the Rivers governor is considered to be the glue holding the nation’s topmost opposition party together.
