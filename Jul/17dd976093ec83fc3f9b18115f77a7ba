Renowned female human rights activists, Comrade Aisha Yesufu, has cautioned the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, Peter Obi, against his rising populism and the potential security risk. Yesufu advised Obi to be careful not to himself to be set up.
Aisha Yesufu recalled her experience when she was a victim of security threat, referring Obi to the #EndSARS protesters how the state unleashed violence and claimed the counter violence came from the #EndSARS groups.
Yesufu in a post on her twitter handle Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu wrote: “@PeterObi is allowing himself to be set up! Just like they did with #EndSars protesters, they will unleash violence & say it was his followers.
“I might not be in politics but I have been at the receiving end of the violent tactics from the establishment.”
Peter Obi had commended his supporters after the mass turnout to welcome him in Abuja. The Labour Party presidential candidate in a tweet, wrote: Peter Obi @PeterObi “I sincerely thank my supporters for believing in me and my commitment to building a united, secure and well-functioning Nigeria. However, I appeal once more that we should be tolerant of other people’s views, dissent and divergent opinions & possibly learn from them.”
Aisha Yesufu, thereafter, noted: Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu “Peter Obi @PeterObi has been part of the establishment and even when he was not was just in Anambra right? Now, Nigerians have seen in him someone that can topple the establishment and entrench good governance, you think they will take it lying down?”
She maintained: Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu “How many of you remembered when they kept saying #EndSars movement will be hijacked? That the protesters should stop protesting or the movement will be hijacked? That is what they are currently doing with Peter Obi and he is nicely falling into their trap!”
She also stated: Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu “The establishment controls the media and when they start a narrative it goes like wildfire. That is what they are doing to Peter Obi @PeterObi at the moment.
“He is naively opening up himself to be put on the defensive. They will do more heinous things and say it is his supporters.”
