The security network seemingly collapsed in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), opening space for bandits to invade the Kuje Prison arena on Tuesday evening, detonating explosives and firing gunshots in the vicinity of the correctional centre.
As at Wednesday morning, details of the attack were still sketchy.
An official of the Nigerian Correctional Service, AD Umar, was said to have confirmed the attack of the correctional centre by gunmen. He, however, said that the situation had been brought under control by security operatives who intervened.
Umar was cited to have highlighted: “I wish to confirm that about 2200hrs, some yet to be identified gunmen attacked the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje in the Federal Capital Territory.
“However, men of the Armed Squad of the Nigerian Correctional Service and other security agencies attached to the Custodial centre have responded and calm has been restored to the facility and the situation is under control.
“Details will be made available soon.”
Bandits had earlier ambushed a presidential advance convoy of President Muhammadu Buhari near Dutsinma, Katsina State.
