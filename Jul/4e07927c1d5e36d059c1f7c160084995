Reno Omokri, a Nigerian activist and aide to former president Goodluck Jonathan, reacted to the photo of her family being shared on social media by some alleged supporters of a presidential candidate for the 2023 election.

Some hours ago, Reno Omokri stated that his life and that of his family are in danger and that if anything should happen to any one of them, then Peter Obi of the Labour Party should be held responsible.Following the statement made by Reno Omokri, photos of him with two different women and his daughter went viral, with those sharing the photos wondering which of the two women in the photos Reno was referring to as his family; the legally married wife he allegedly abandoned in Antioch, California, or the Ethiopian lady he allegedly impregnated and is now living with in London.
In light of that, Reno Omokri took to his Twitter page and dragged those who used his little daughter as a propaganda tool against him, stating that such people are capable of killing.
He made his statement while stating that he can never be intimidated by anyone with the claim that Abacha and Sergeant Rogers will be child’s play to what those people that use his daughter’s photos to troll him will unleash in Nigeria if they win the election.He concluded his statement with the claim that those trying to intimidate him and the candidate they are supporting would not smell the Aso Rock.
