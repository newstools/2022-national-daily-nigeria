Popular Nigerian rapper, Jude Abaga, aka Mr Incredible (MI), has said that he will be dropping his stage name for something new. In a twitter post, the decorated rapper notes that come July 10, he will be adopting a new name which he didn’t disclose to his followers.
Citing reasons for the name change, MI said that it is because his soon-to-be-released album was difficult to make and so deserves a new name.
He wrote; “After 15 years as Mr. Incredible, I will be retiring the name MI ABaga and taking on a new name for my new project because my new album hard… and it deserves a new name. My final act as MI will be a performance at ‘The Vibe’ on the 10th of July where I will celebrate my legacy as Africa’s greatest rapper.”
In December last year, MI announced to his fans that a new album is in the works. In a webcast hosted by fellow rapper and actor, Ikechukwu, MI also previewed a new single titled ‘The Guy’ off the album.
MI’s last project was the ‘Judah’ EP which dropped in the middle of 2020. Prior to that, his last album, ‘Yxng Denzel: A Study on Self Worth’ was released back in 2019. Since whetting the appetite of his fans last December, there have been calls for him to release his album.
