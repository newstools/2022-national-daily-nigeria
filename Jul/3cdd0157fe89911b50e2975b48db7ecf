Speaking at the orientation course on Thursday in Abuja, NCPC Executive Secretary, Rev. Yakubu Pam, reminded them that “pilgrimage is a spiritual journey, not a jamboree”.
Pam, who was represented by the Director of Administration NCPC, Mr Barnabas Ali said that the intending pilgrims must also regard the exercise as important to their spiritual growth.
He, therefore, urged them to focus on their mission to the holy land and be good ambassadors of Nigeria.
The executive secretary warned the intending pilgrims against absconding, so as not to dent the image of the country.
“You are a king in your country, so why will you want to be slave in another country,” he admonished the intending pilgrims.
The NCPC boss urged them to “ pray for the peace of Nigeria because it is only God that can fix the challenges we face as a nation.”
In his remarks, the Head of Security NCPC, Mr Hosea Allahbamu advised the intending pilgrims to observe all necessary protocols as they travelled out of the shores of the country.
“While on pilgrimage, think about your safety, because the safety of our pilgrims is paramount to us,” he added.
Allahbamu assured that the commission would do everything humanly possible to ensure the wellbeing and the comfort of the pilgrims.
He further urged them to exhibit the best behaviour, while in the holy land and follow laid down security rules as they embarked on the journey.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the self-sponsored intending pilgrims would depart for Israel and Jordan from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.
