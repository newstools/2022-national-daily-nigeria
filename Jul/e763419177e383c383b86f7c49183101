A Construction company PW has been accused of building and expanding its space on a waterway leading to the collapse of a building housing a widow and her five children.
The collapse of the building was as a result of a heavy rain that fell in Jos on Saturday afternoon, bringing some houses down as water was forced to overflow causing flooding as it tried to find its way due to lack of proper drainage.
Speaking after the disaster, a resident narrated to our correspondent how several appeals were made to the construction company to construct alternative drainage to ease flow of water.
The resident who does not want his name on print explained how the neighborhood has suffered over the years from the blocked drainage by the construction company PW.
“All the houses that share a fence with the construction company have all collapsed because PW refused to build drainages. We have pleaded with them to build alternative drainage to allow water to have its way but the construction company will do nothing about it.
“Now with this heavy rain buildings including that of a widow with five children have been destroyed.
“The building of the widow collapsed and it took only the grace of God that the widow survived.
“The widow who bred birds lost all her chickens numbering over 200.
“When the neighborhood approached PW the soldiers stationed at the gate will chase them away”, the resident said.
He wondered how a construction company in the state for over four decades will not construct a drainage for its host community, rather it expands its company building on an existing drainage to stall water from having its way.
