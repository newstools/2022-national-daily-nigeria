A former senator who represented Rivers South-East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, a leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Magnus Abe, has declared that he will withhold his support for party candidates in the state in the  2023 general elections. Abe emphatically declared that he will not support the APC governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Cole, in the 2023 elections.
Abe, a governorship aspirant of the APC, was cited to have stated: “I will not support Tonye Cole, I think that is clear to everybody.”
Abe protested that Cole does not have a record of service in Rivers State, adding that he has allegations of corruption hanging on him. He threatened to work against the election of the APC governorship candidate.
According to Abe, “I am not part of how he became a candidate, he has not been part of our party to my knowledge, and he didn’t contribute anything to the establishment of the party. He has no record of service to our state.
“There is an allegation that over $55 million of Rivers State Government money was transferred to him by Rotimi Amaechi in a government in which I served and I didn’t even know about it. So how will I now go and support such a person to now take over the Government of Rivers State?”
