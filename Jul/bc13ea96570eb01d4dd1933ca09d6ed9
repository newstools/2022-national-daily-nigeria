Prince Eze Madumere, a former deputy governor of Imo State, has expressed his sadness over the killing of 14 Otulu youths of Oru West Local Government Area of Imo State on Sunday.
Prince Madumere expressed his sadness in a statement issued by his media aide, Hon Uche Onwuchekwa, demanding that there be immediate independent investigations into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of these youths.
The former deputy governor insisted that securing Imo and warding off criminal elements does not include erasing the youthful human resources of the State.
He called for an independent investigation into the root cause of the myriad reports of killings of innocent family members and other incidents of deaths shrouded in mystery.

“While we commend the governor for his resolute stance in keeping Imo State safe, the sordid happenings and alleged killings directed at the youthful population of Imo West Senatorial zone must be condemned in its entirety.”
“We call for an independent investigation into some of the reported mysterious killings. Some families have been wiped out while others have been eternally injured. Most of these people are said to be innocent of any gangsterism, banditry and other criminal activities.
“I have always recommended deployment of a crisis resolution approach to resolving some of these security challenges. We have tried it in the past and we got great results. Carrot and stick is part of the strategies and everything is wrong if we continue to keep quiet just to be politically correct.”
Prince Madumere further called on Governor Hope Uzodimma to review the modus operandi of the state government’s sponsored “Ebubeagu” to avoid wiping out those who will sustain the existence of Imo as a State.
