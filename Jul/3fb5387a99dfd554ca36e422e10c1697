Babachir Lawal, the aggrieved ally of the APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu has got the first hit from a member of the panel that recommended Sen. Kashim Shettima for the VP slot.
Former Sen Magnus Abe believes Babachir posing as Tinubu’s associate yet criticizing the APC presidential candidate openly is out of order.
Abe, an ally of Tinubu from the south-south,  also revealed that the choice of Shettima was based on the recommendation of the committee which Babchir chaired, adding that there would always be a reaction, no matter the choice made.
“With all due respect to my friend and brother, Lawal, I think that the path he has chosen is his personal path. First of all, the way he talks down in Asiwaju in public every time things are not going the way he likes them to go I considered it very disrespectful,” Abe said on ARISE TV on Thirsday.
According to him, he does not speak as a citizen who is talking as guaranteed by the constitution, but as an associate of Asiwaju.
“That’s what gives prominence to what he’s saying.
“If you are speaking as an associate of somebody who you publicly proclaim is your friend, you are his supporter, you are working to make him president, you should show him some respect.”
Concerning Babachir’s belly ache on a Muslim-Muslim ticket, Abe said it is not only the position of the vice president that will bring unity.
“If a Christian and a Muslim ticket was to guarantee unity, Nigeria should be very united,” he said referring to President Muhammadu Buhari and his V.P. Yemi Osinbajo, a pastor.
“ So, it is clear that there are other factors that guarantee unity.”
