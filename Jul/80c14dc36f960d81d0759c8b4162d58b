The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has reassured that the Federal Government is committed to the completion of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, reaffirming the  government’s resolve  to deliver infrastructural projects to Nigerians. The minister promised that the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway will be delivered before December 25, 2022.
Fashola had commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts to deliver dividends of democracy in the country. According to Fashola, “People used to do a one-week trip for a whole day, so that is progress. We plan to finish this year.”
Fashola said that the Oyo State Government is yet to play its role to aid the speedy completion of the road project, which he said the federal government is waiting for.
Fashola had highlighted: “It is less than two hours now to go to Ibadan, you can do Ibadan and come back twice a day now and we haven’t finished. We don’t want to finish and the road is open again.
“If you see, the lane marking is already going on, the road furniture is simultaneously being installed, road marking is going on and we are waiting for Oyo State. Governor Makinde and I will resolve that pretty soon.”
