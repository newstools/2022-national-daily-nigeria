A former Chelsea star, Glenn Johnson, had told the Chelsea management to retain the France international at Stamford Bridge and should not allow him join Arsenal.
The Gunners have been linked to search for the France international in the new season, and want the Chelsea midfielder, Kante, the leave Standford bridge this season.
Kante has one year remaining in his contract with Chelsea, and there is no indication of renewal yet. rather there are indications that the Chelsea may be considering taking advantage of the remaining deal to bargain for good financial transfer deals this summer.
Chelsea were said to be seeking to replace Kante with Guido Rodriguez, Real Betis midfielder.
Glenn Johnson warned that any team would desire to have N’Golo Kante, saying he delivers any time he plays, and has a lot to offer The Blues.
According to Glenn Johnson, “Any team would want N’Golo Kante.
“We all know what he does and what he’s going to do because he delivers every time he plays and still has a lot to deliver at Chelsea.
“I can’t see Chelsea letting him go to Arsenal, to be honest. Arsenal is nowhere near a threat to Chelsea, so, I can’t see N’Golo wanting to go there just yet.
“He’s got plenty more in the tank.”
