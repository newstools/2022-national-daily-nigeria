Zelenskyy’s office has detailed the toll on Ukrainian sport during the Russian invasion, now in a fifth month.
A total of 89 athletes and coaches have died “as a result of hostilities,” 13 more have been captured by the Russians, and “more than a hundred thousand Ukrainian athletes do not have the opportunity of training,” Zelenskyy has said.
