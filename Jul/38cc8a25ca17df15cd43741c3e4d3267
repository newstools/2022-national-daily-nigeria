The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that seasonal diseases arise due to change in environmental conditions during different seasons, causing periodic surge in disease incidence corresponding to such seasons.
NAN also reports that seasonal infections of humans range from childhood diseases such as measles, diphtheria and chickenpox, to faecal–oral infections, such as cholera.

Tor-Agbidye, therefore, told NAN in Abuja on Monday that sound sleep strengthen the immune system against viruses and bacteria.

He added that “it is when the immune system is overwhelmed that the body becomes sick with either catarrh or cough.

“People should imbibe healthy lifestyle that will aid their immune system, as taking foods that are rich in Vitamin D strengthen the
system,” he said.

The medical practitioner, who regretted that many foods eaten today were bereft of necessary nutrients and vitamins, urged people to always consider the health benefits of  foods before eating.

He also advised people to consult their doctor before taking any kind of supplement.
