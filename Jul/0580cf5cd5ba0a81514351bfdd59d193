People have reacted differently after Jack Obinyan, a social media influencer who is also a strong supporter of Labour Party presidential candidate Peter Obi, showed how overcrowded Labour Party meetings are.
It is the belief of many people that the Labour party doesn’t have the needed structure that can boost its capacity to win the presidential election in Nigeria, unlike the two other giant party, the PDP and APC, who have governors and lawmakers in the government.
Some people also claimed that the supporters of the Labour Party were only on social media and that a party with no huge grassroots supporters had a low chance of winning.
However, in the photo that Jack Obinyan shares, hundreds of people can be counted from the people that attend the party meeting of Exco that is going on in Delta state.Many people reacted differently to the photos, with some claiming that the crowded meeting of the Labour Party shows that the party may do better than people think in the upcoming election.
