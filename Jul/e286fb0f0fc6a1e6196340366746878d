Meanwhile, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has expressed worry over the recent astronomical increase in the price of diesel, noting that it portends negative consequences for the manufacturing sector and the larger economy.
MAN in a statement signed by its Director-General of MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, asked the federal government to issue its members licenses to import diesel from the Republic of Niger and Chad in order to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing activities that could arise from total shut down of production operations.
Ajayi-Kadir pointed out that Nigerian manufacturers are worried about the implications of the over 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector.
