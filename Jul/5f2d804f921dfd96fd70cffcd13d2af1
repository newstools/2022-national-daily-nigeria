Barely weeks after some All Progressives Congress visited Rivers state governor, Nyesom Wike, another top chieftain of the party, this time the immediate-past Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, has also visited Wike.
It was gathered that Yari visited the PDP chieftain on Tuesday at his private residence in Port Harcourt.

Yari upon arrival at Wike’s residence, located in Rumuepriokom community in Obio/Akpor local government area of the State, went into a closed-door meeting with Rivers State governor.
Recall that Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State had led Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State and Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to meet with Wike.
The APC Governors took advantage of the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to meet with Wike and convince him to join the ruling party.
