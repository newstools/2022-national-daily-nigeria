Ogiasa had been kidnapped early June from his hometown, Otuabadi in Ogbia Local Government Area of the state.
The victim spoke from inside a flooded grave, half naked with a sack over his head for some parts of the video.
Begging for his life, Ogiasa said, “Is the money more important than my life? You’re seeing me in the grave. Please do everything to come and release me.”
