Kalidou Koulibaly just signed a transfer agreement with Chelsea, moving from Napoli, and he will soon join the London squad in Las Vegas.
While many supporters applaud Koulibaly’s transfer, others object to the idea of Chelsea combining two overage players at the back (Thiago Silva and Koulibaly).
Below are comments made by fans in response to a post about Silva and Koulibaly that was made by ESPN UK.

Despite the fact that age may not be on Silva and Koulibaly’s sides, both have established themselves as some of the top players in the game.
Chelsea has been linked with other defenders such as Presnel Kimpembe and Nathan Ake from PSG and Man City respectively and they hope to have the signature of one of them.
The Blues had a very successful season last year, and they will be striving for an even better one this coming year.
