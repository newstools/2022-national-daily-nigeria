Although listed as a guest speaker, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo didn’t show in the Osun APC guber rally that sported no fewer than 10 governors and other party stalwarts in Osogbo on Tuesday.
Also absent was Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola, a sworn enemy of the state Gov. Adegboyega Oyetola seeking re-election.
The mega rally committee in a statement on Monday, signed by its spokesperson, Funke Egbemode, Aregbesola from the listed speakers.
Sola Fasure, the media to Aregbesola, said his boss was not invited for the event, and the minister was attending an official event in Lagos on Tuesday.
Even if invited, Aregbesola could have found it difficult doing much to support Oyetola because the minister’s candidate for the APC ticket, Moshood Adeoti, is still contending Oyetola’s victory in court.
For Osinsjo, his defeat at the presidential primary has widened the social distance between him and the APC presidential flagbearr Bola Tinubu.
Some of the governors in attendance included: Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna, Abdulrahaman Abudulrasak of Kwara, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, and Prof. Babagana Zullum of Borno States.
Also in attendance were; a former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; the 2023 APC presidential flagbearer and his running mate, Tinubu, Kashim Shettima.
