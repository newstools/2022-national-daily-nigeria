The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, has come under fire after joining the ongoing #LabourChallenge on Twitter.
#LabourChallenge started on Twitter after Tinubu said his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi and his supporters will labour till they die.
This however, did not go down well with many Nigerians, especially the yourhs.
Supporters of Obi started a trend on Twitter to showcase their skills and Tinubu hooped in.
He tweeted while sharing a picture of a meeting he had with some unknown youths.
Working hard to secure our future, one for all Nigerians, for our families and our great nation.
Hard work is Nigerian.
Proud to be working hard with Nigerians by my side.

His tweet drew a slew of reactions with many bashing him for joining the challenge after insulting labourers.
