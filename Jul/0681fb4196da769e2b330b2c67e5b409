Knoxville News Sentinel has reported that Nigerian officials “blamed the terror attack on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, on the Islamic State West Africa Province while allegedly avoiding references to networks of politically powerful herdsmen”.
Speaking on the recent massacre of worshippers at the Catholic Church, a senior fellow at the Religious Freedom Institute in Washington DC, Stephen Rasche, said Nigerian Christians no longer trust their own government or the leaders of the United States and the European Union.
Punch reported that Rasche said; “These types of murders are taking place weekly, almost daily, in Nigeria — murders of innocent Christians, being gunned down, slaughtered indiscriminately, throughout the north and, increasingly, into the central part of Nigeria and into the south.
