Nigerians are having a field day at the expense of talented singer Burnaboy after his ex-girllfriend was seen giving Sean Paul a free lapdance.
Steflon Don and Jamaican superstar Paul had a recent performance together in Germany which Steflon turned into a s*ftcore p*rn session.
She rubbed her backside all over the Jamaican legend who couldn’t believe the free strip show he was receiving from his co-star.
Steflon grinded him down like pepper on a grinding stone, sending Sean Paul into ecstasy and Nigerians into trolling mode.
Burnaboy was heavily trolled by fans who mocked him for suffering a broken heart.
According to netizens, he definitely lost the breakup and would be in pains to watch Steflon freely give herself out like that.
One fan wrote: “Burna just left d room,” 
Another added: “Odogwu go feel this one,”
The most hilarious comment came from a 3rd fan: “Last last nah everybody go chop breakfast ”
