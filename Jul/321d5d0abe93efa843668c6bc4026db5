Thomas Tuchel and Chelsea have been in the process of building a formidable defence line at Stamford Bridge after the Blues witnessed the departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen to Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively.
The west London club who had last week completed the signing of Napoli defence stalwart Kalidou Koulibaly are still preparing the bid to recruit the services of yet another top defender Jules Kounde.
The France international is believed to be the next likely defender through the door at Stamford Bridge after the lengthy pursuit of the 23-year-old former Bordeaux star.
National Daily gathered from the claim by AS that Kounde will be moving to Chelsea despite discussions with Barcelona and the deal to bring him to Stamford Bridge could be finalized hopefully this week.  
Sevilla have been looking for €60m (£51m) for the 23-year-old and Chelsea are expected to pay a fee in that ballpark for the Frenchman.
There is no doubt that former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho who is a renowned for his defensive tactics could be envious of the rebuilding process at Stamford Bridge.
Meanwhile, Chelsea may have beaten Barca to Kounde, but the Catalan giants are still looking to get hold of two more Chelsea players after the arrival of Christensen on a free transfer this summer.
Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso remain targets for Barcelona, but progress is slow on deals for the two Spaniards.
