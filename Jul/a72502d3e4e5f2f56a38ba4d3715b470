According to the Kano governor, Oyetola is the only Muslim governor in the south-west, noting that he was their ‘brother’.
He said this in a BBC Hausa service interview in Osogbo while canvassing votes for Oyetola in mosque.
Ganduje reportedly visited the mosque, and  met with the Hausa community in Osogbo, canvassing vote for Oyetola.
“Please, the person you should vote for is Oyetola. Do you know why? This is because he is a Muslim like you. We are guiding you on the path (to follow),” he said.
Ganduje also noted that because the APC presidential candidate was told to pick a Musli as his running mate, and he did—so the Muslims must pay back by voting for Oyetola.
Responding to a question asked by a member of the audience, he said, “For the progress of the country, we don’t have to be religious-biased.
“Christians are also our brothers, too. We must also support them.
“When the Hausa said they are the ones that should return to the seat, we said no, ‘It was the turn of the Yoruba.
“That is why we have chosen Bola Ahmed Tinubu. That is the only way we will be able to avert fighting and crises. I’m here to help our brother (Oyetola) who we want to win the election tomorrow.”
The APC is facing criticism for its Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, many alleging its part of Islamization agenda.
