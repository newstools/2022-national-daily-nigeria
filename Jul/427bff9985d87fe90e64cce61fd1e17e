Three African countries have reached an agreement to lay an intercontinental gas pipeline from Africa to Europe to provide alternative source of energy for European countries in the aftermath of the energy crisis during the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Energy conglomerates in Algeria, Nigeria and Niger signed a memorandum of understanding on gas pipeline project from the African continent to Europe for gas supply to the European Union (EU).
The gas pipeline project indicated that Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP) has the mandate to convey billions of cubic metres of gas across 4,128 kilometres (2,565 miles) from West Africa – Nigeria, via Niger to North Africa, passing through Algeria, into the Mediterranean undersea Transmed pipeline to Italy, or loaded onto liquefied natural gas tankers for export.
The Minister of Energy in Algeria, Mohamed Arkab, at a forum with the Minister of State for Petroleum in Nigeria, Timipre Sylva, and Energy Minister in Niger, Mahamane Sani, in Algiers deliberated on the interconnection gas supply project to Europe.
Meanwhile, the price of cooking gas has risen astronomically in Nigeria.
