People don’t just have stretch marks because of pregnancy and childbirth. We have some men that are also looking for what they can do to fade away stretch marks. According to Healthline, this skin condition is not just peculiar to women.
This also appears on the skin of some men, especially the lower part of their arms, thighs, and stomachs. There’s a popular belief that women have stretch marks because of pregnancy.
However, men don’t give birth like women, but they can develop stretch marks for various reasons. Some men have them, but they are not very obvious until you take a closer look. You will see some red or white lines on their skin.
This is medically called striae distensae, but people who are not in the medical world call it stretch marks. The following are reasons why men also have stretch marks:
1. If a young man is disposed to be fat when he grows up, he will suddenly start having stretch marks when he reaches puberty. He might start seeing them around his chest, close to his armpits.
2. A man can have stretch marks if he has a family history of a father or grandfather who had stretch marks. This can also predispose him to have it when he reaches a certain age.
3. If a man suddenly gains weight or loses weight, this can cause some type of reaction in his skin and make stretch marks appear. What causes the fluctuation in his weight could be dietary changes or lifestyle adjustments.
4. Using a corticosteroid body cream can cause a man’s skin to lean and stretch marks to appear. Some men who inject themselves with steroids or take drugs to build their muscles can also see their skin shrink after a while. This can also cause stretch marks.
5. There are also health problems such as Cushing’s syndrome that can cause hormonal imbalance and increase the level of cortisone hormones in the body. When this happens to a man, it can cause him to have stretch marks.
