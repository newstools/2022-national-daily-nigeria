The veteran actor, Yemi Solade, has made some revelations regarding the Yoruba actors who recently endorsed the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu. Solade also revealed on TVC what he would do if TAMPAN endorsed any presidential candidate.
Addressing the topic, Yemi said, “Those people who endorsed APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, did so at their own volition.” They do not represent Nollywood, but they are the faces you see in Nollywood movies. They did not even go under the aegis of a professional body. They went on their own.
He continued, “I saw the video, but I did not finish watching it as I was not interested in it.” I will not be part of it. I think it would be wrong for TAMPAN to endorse anybody, and I will not be a party to that. I would cry if TAMPAN does so. However, individuals have the right to endorse anyone. For example, if I did so, it would be Yemi Solade doing so. Actors have the right to participate in politics, but I cannot do so due to the nature of politics here. Most people are running into politics for money. It is a big business, and many people sell all they have ever worked for and incur debt for it.
