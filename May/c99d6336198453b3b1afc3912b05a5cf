Many people have been feared killed, shops, houses and vehicles burnt during a clash between traders and commercial motorcyclists, popularly called Okada riders at Dei Dei, a community in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
According to SaharaReporters, a source said that an accident involving a commercial motorcyclist led to the clash.
“Ongoing clash between traders and Okada riders in a very big market located in the Federal Capital city of Nigeria, Abuja. As of now, I’m not sure how many people have been killed,” he said.
A truck reportedly crushed a woman to death following the alleged reckless riding of the commercial motorcycle she had taken.
The deceased, who happened to be an Igbo woman was said to be on a bike when the accident occurred. “She died while being rushed to the hospital,” an eyewitness said.
The tragedy compelled some traders in the area to run after the motorbike and set it ablaze. This triggered a reprisal from commercial motorcyclists in the area.

The rampaging commercial motorcyclists allegedly blocked the expressway and attacked motorists in the process.
Many vehicles and shops, particularly the ones selling building materials, were said to be burnt and destroyed.
The aforementioned publication reported that a source also said some churches were also attacked, leaving many people injured.
Motorists were forced to take alternative routes to avoid being caught up in the melee.
“The agitated youths who witnessed this burnt the motorcycle at building materials market in Dei-Dei, Abuja. As at the time of filing this report, the police are already at the scene and trying to quell the situation,” one of the eyewitnesses said.
