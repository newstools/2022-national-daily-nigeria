Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has received a huge congratulation from President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of his 56th birthday May 29, 2022.
Buhari has seized the opportunity to join members of the Dare family, friends and well-wishers in praying for health, longevity and happiness for the celebrant.
The President thanks the Minister for playing pivotal roles in the transformation of the youth and sports sector in recent years, leading to the country clocking more laurels in international tournaments and competitions.
According to the President, history will positively remember Dare for leading at a time when sporting facilities, including the Lagos and Abuja National Stadiums, were renovated, sports reclassified as business and not just recreational activity, thereby repositioning the sector as a viable revenue earner.
