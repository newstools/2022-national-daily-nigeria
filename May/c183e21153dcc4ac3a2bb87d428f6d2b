The Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Charles Soludo has hinted on his meeting with the leader of the Indegenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and the meeting was for the progress of the south east in general.
According to Soludo, “I visited Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, on Friday, to felicitate with him and also as part of the wider consultations with critical stakeholders in search of lasting peace and security in the South East.
He was in very high spirits and we had quality and frank discussion in a very convivial atmosphere. He expressed sadness over what he described as “sacrilegious killings” of innocent persons, kidnappings and all forms of criminalities, including the brutal enforcement of the senseless “sit at home” perpetuated by sundry groups claiming to be acting for or on behalf of IPOB.
According to him, Nnamdi assured that if the opportunity arises, he will be glad to personally broadcast to his followers to maintain the peace.
