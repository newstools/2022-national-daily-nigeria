The amount was likely part of their rakings from internet frauds.
Shogbola, aka Oja or Federal, accused Victor of cheating him and taking all the money to himself.
After the initial verbal exchange in the morning, Shogbola posted a picture of Victor online, tagged it with a RIP about 8p m Tuesday.
By 11 pm, Victor was reportedly stabbed to death, and Shogbola came out of nowhere bloodied, and ready to flee.
But commercial motorcyclists refused to let him get on their bikes.
Onyemaechi Onwuzuribe, a friend of Victor’s, later witnessed how neighbours aware of the murder wanted to lynch Shogbola.
“Federal was bloodied and I saw him running away though I did not know that he had stabbed Victor. I knew that they fought earlier that morning over $150 and as soon as I saw him running, I sensed that he must have done something,” he said.
“I grabbed him and just as I did, I saw people running after him and crying that he had stabbed Victor to death. That was when I and others tried to hold him, but he escaped and went to the police.”
