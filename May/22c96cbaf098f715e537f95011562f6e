Real Madrid president Florentino Perez who is obviously in a jubilant mood after he witnessed Los Blancos win their 14th Champions League trophy after Vinicius Junior’s second-half goal sealed a 1-0 victory over Liverpool at the Stade de France on Saturday night.
The Spanish club have also ended the season with their 35th La Liga title after they finished 13 points above Barcelona.
Madrid had made the signing of Mbappe their top priority ahead of the summer transfer window, but after agreeing a deal to join the Spanish club, the France international performed a last-minute U-turn and signed a contract extension with Paris Saint-Germain.
When asked about Mbappe’s decision after the final, Perez was dismissive of the 23-year-old’s decision to snub Madrid.
‘Every year we try to bring someone in, but this forward line is difficult to improve,’ Perez told Movistar after the final.
When asked if Mbappe would have been an improvement, Perez replied: ‘Today, Mbappe doesn’t exist, Real Madrid exist.
‘It’s a party for Real Madrid and their players, who have been champions of Europe.’
