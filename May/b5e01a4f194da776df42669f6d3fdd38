After Senator Shehu Sani lost the People’s Democratic Party Governorship primaries to Dr. Isa Ashiru, he revealed that he was able to pull just two votes. He however wished to meet the delegates who voted for him to show his appreciation for voting for him without receiving a dime from him.
However, Senator Shehu Sani has said that despite having just two votes at the end of the People’s Democratic Party Governorship primaries of Kaduna State, more than three hundred (300) delegates have called him in respect of the election and the votes he gathered.
Senator Shehu Sani, on Twitter said that the over 300 different delegates who have called him, all claimed that they are the delegates that voted for him. He also said that the delegates said that they want to come and see him.
However, his fans are wondering how that could be possible; having two votes but receiving over 300 calls from different delegates claiming to be his voters.
It is left for him to figure out who among the 300 delegates that have called him are the ones that actually voted for him.
