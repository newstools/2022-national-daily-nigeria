Former Deputy Senate President Senator Ike Ekweremadu has lost all chances to clinch any ticket to run for any office in 2023 elections in Enugu.
While he pulled out of his drive for the PDP guber drive after over two decades in the Senate, he took his chances in the APC on Tuesday, with the backing of Imo Gov. Hope Uzodinma.
His chances now appear zilch.
Although the two met with the APC national chairman Abdulahi Adamu on Monday, the outcome was not favourable.
The closed-door meeting which lasted three hours at the party’s secretariat in Abuja gave the PDP stalwart an opportunity to make hi request: the APC guber ticket.
According to sources, he was told that the party had already concluded its guber primaries, and Uche Nnaji emerged candidate.
The primary was conducted about the time PDP had its own, which Ekweremadu refused to contest.
All primaries elections for the NASS assemblies aspirants have also been concluded, and winners have emerged.
The APC secretariat, however, advised Ekweremadu to join the party first.
