He will be contesting the APC primary on Sunday, despite all his denial he is contesting.
“The road is now fully clear, we give God the glory, ” the Punch quoted sources from the Jonathan camp as saying Thursday. “GEJ has finally been given the waiver, he will contest on Sunday.”
This came less than 48 hours after the PDP stalwart met Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari’s cousin and head of Aso Rock cabal.
Again, also coming up May 27 is a court ruling over the suit filed in Bayelsa to contest the eligibility of Jonathan to contest after taking the oath of office as president twice.
In an origination summons filed by Andy Solomon and Idibiye Abraham, the plaintiffs are seeking an order of the court stating that Jonathan is not affected by the fourth alteration to the constitution barring Vice-Presidents who succeed their principals from serving more than one full term.
In the suit marked FHC/YNG/CS/86/2022 which is before Justice Isa Dashen, the All Progressives Congress, Jonathan and the Independent National Electoral Commission are listed as defendants.
That judgment is going to e delivered before the APC primary which is slated for Sunday, the plaintiffs requested an accelerated hearing via a motion ex parte.
The court granted an accelerated hearing of the suit “having regard to the nature of the suit and the reliefs sought therein.”
The court also directed the respondents to be served with the enrolment order alongside the originating summons and the defendants to file their responses.
Counter-affidavits and further affidavits had been filed, and Justice Dashen fixed May 27 for judgment.
The APC has been adjusting its primaries all along for these events to fall in line.
