The gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education Sokoto State, had been the talk of the town as many people are not happy with how this lady was lynched by angry students.
Recently, a popular human rights activist, author and renowned lawyer, Reno Omokri has just taken to his verified social media page to share how Abacha treated a case like this during his administration.
In his tweet, Reno Omokri said “Abacha may have been corrupt, but we can learn from how he handled issues like the Sokoto incident. He dealt squarely with those who killed Gideon Akaluka. All but one were executed. Abacha could have turned a blind eye to the Akaluka beheading, but he didn’t! #JusticeForDeborah”
Story has it that Gideon Akaluka, a young trader, who allegedly desecrated the Koran and was beheaded by group of angry people. It was reported that those people who killed Gideon were arrested under the administration of General Sani Abacha and they were seriously dealt with.
According to Reno Omokri, he said if there is nothing to learn from General Sani Abacha’s administration, the way he handled Gideon’s issue should be studied carefully.
