Reno Omokri, a former media aide of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has called for investigation into the killing of a student in Sokoto for alleged blasphemy, making reference to Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai in the process.
The victim simply identified as Deborah was a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education. She was attacked by fellow students for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad.
Mr Omokri alleged in a tweet on Thursday that El-Rufai insulted Jesus, but was not harmed by Christians.
“The gruesome killing of the female student, whose name I understand to be Deborah, in Sokoto on allegations of blaspheming Prophet Mohammed SAW must be investigated and the culprits must be severely punished,” he said.
“@Elrufai insulted Christ, but Christians didn’t kill him!”


Deborah is reported to have blasphemed against Prophet Muhammad by describing a message about the prophet as “nonsense” on a WhatsApp group meant for academics.
According to a student who witnessed the incident, the female student was first evacuated to the security post of the school following threats to her safety.
But the mob pursued her to the security post and overpowered the personnel there.
