Chelsea are set to spend £200million on new signings once their takeover by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly goes through.


And the Blues have already drawn up an eight-player shortlist of targets to improve Thomas Tuchel’s squad.


The £4.25billion purchase of the West London club is set to be confirmed after it was given the green light by the UK Government.


The Telegraph say the Boehly-led consortium want to mark the start of a new era by backing manager Tuchel significantly in the transfer market.


It is claimed that the German boss will be given significant funds to use on re-shaping his squad and already knows the defensive reinforcements he wants.


Antonio Rudiger has agreed to join Real Madrid, while Andreas Christensen, Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso could all follow him out of the exit door.


The report indicates Sevilla’s Jules Kounde and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol sit near the top of the list of potential replacements.


The Blues have a long-term admiration for Kounde, having been priced out of a move for the 23-year-old French international last summer.


Croatia international Gvardiol, 20, is regarded as one of Europe’s top defensive talents and would solve their vacancy on the left side of the back three — he can also fill in at left-back.


Pau Torres of Villarreal and Jose Gimenez of Atletico Madrid also feature on the wish list, though Chelsea could face competition from their Premier League rivals if they pursue deals for either.


Tuchel is also keen to strengthen in midfield and in attack, with N’Golo Kante,  Jorginho,  Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic, Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner all facing uncertain futures in West London.
