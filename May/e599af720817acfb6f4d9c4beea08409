A wing of Biafra agitators in the coastal zone, the Biafra Nations League (BNL), has raised alarm, alleging that the Nigeria Police are plotting secret execution of BNL members arrested in Ikom, Cross River State, few days ago. BNL Deputy National Leader, Ebuta Takon, also an Ejagham, alleged that the “Police attempted to secretly execute the Ejagham supporters save for online bloggers, who first published the information.”
Takon also alleged that the Police are starving Ejagham supporters in their custody, as well as denying them any form of visitation.
Takon threatened that the situation in the Bakassi peninsula, including the southeast, would be worse, compared to “what will happen if the BNL members are detained for long without trial.”
Takon declared: “the Ejagham people across the Southeastern end will align with their Ejagham brothers in Southern Cameroons to ensure that there is no peace around the borders which are inhabited by the Ejagham on both sides of the countries.
“They know what Ejagham people are capable of doing, as inhabitants of major hinterland border towns, and members of two countries (Nigeria and Cameroon), we are capable of terminating business activities around our borders.
“This action might lead to what they don’t expect.
“They should not play with our people, because we don’t bark but bite.”
