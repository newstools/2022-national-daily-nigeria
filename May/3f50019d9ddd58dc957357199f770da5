The Democratic Forum for Justice and Equity (DFJE), among others, has said it regrets supporting the candidate.
Mallam Isah Ajilete, the national coordinator of the group, Malam said it has now withdrawn its loyalties.
“We have withdrawn our support for Peter Obi, having realised that he is an unstable politician who has taken his desperation to a selfish level. We made bold to say that we regretted ever supporting Peter Obi in the first place and we have since shifted our loyalty to a stable politician,” a statement by the group said on Friday.
Obi is still rolling around, though, shopping.
There are speculations the Labour Party may not offer him what he wants, and he’s already considering the NNPP, a black horse of new party that made some stir in Kano.
Its national leader and Kano’s ex-Gov. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is angling for the party’s presidential ticket.
