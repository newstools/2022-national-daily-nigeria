Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi stated this while addressing the party delegates in Edo on the weekend.
Amaechi urged them not to be carried away by the list of aspirants from the ruling party.
“Politicians will come to ask for your votes, but please, as South-South people, as politicians, as good people of Nigeria, don’t waste your votes. The problem with politicians is you.
“The elites have shown you that they are here to ‘chop money’ and you allow them. They will bring money here and say you should vote for them, and nobody will care to ask ‘what was he before now, what is his performance?’
“The economy they want to come and manage, how have they performed?
“The electability of a candidate is essential for you, if not, the APC will lose the election.”
