The wait for Champions League glory for Manchester City goes on as the Citizens were knocked out in the semi-final by a resolute 2021/2022 la liga crowned champions Real Madrid.
Sequel to the painful elimination, Pep Guardiola has finally broken his silence as he urges Manchester City to accept their latest Champions League heartbreak and refocus on their bid to retain the Premier League.
National Daily observed that City were moments away from setting up an all-English final against Liverpool before Real launched a remarkable comeback at the Bernabeu.
A second-half goal from Riyad Mahrez the Premier League champions on the brink but two goals inside two minutes from Rodrygo in injury time saw Real force extra-time with the tie poised at 5-5 on aggregate.

Real held on to ensure City’s agonising wait for a Champions League triumph goes on for at least another season.
‘We were close. But at the end we could not reach it,’ Guardiola told BT Sport, reacting to the defeat.
‘It is simple, the first half we didn’t have a good game, we were not giving enough but we didn’t suffer much. We were better after the goal, we found our tempo. And in the last 10 mins we didn’t suffer.
‘There were moments, but we were not under pressure, this was not the case. They put a lot of players in the box, Rodrygo, Vinicius, Benzema, Asensio, with crosses and scored twice.
‘We didn’t suffer much but we didn’t play our best but this is normal. We were close. Football is unpredictable and sometimes you have to accept it.
Asked about the mood in the City dressing room, Guardiola added: They are sad. Because we were close. Now we need time to process and come back in our last games.’
