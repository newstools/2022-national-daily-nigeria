A counter terrorist group, Ansaru, has commenced recruitment of locals in Kaduna State to defend their communities and confront bandits in northwest Nigeria.
Speaking on the security situation in the northwest, Nigeria, a leader of a community in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area, Kaduna State, Zubar Abdurra’uf, a former Head of Kaduna State Media Corporation, was gathered to have narrated the processes adopted by the Ansaru terrorists to recruit locals for counter violence against bandits. Zubar Abdurra’uf speaking of Channels TV on Monday morning, monitored from Lagos, disclosed that the Ansaru group has occupied some communities in Kaduna and are protecting the residents from attacks by armed bandits.
Abdurra’uf revealed that the terrorists move around on motorcycles in military uniforms in veracious communities, noting that some locals feel secured seeing them in their communities to assist in fighting the bandits in the UAC forest.
Abdurra’uf had highlighted: “If you look at Giwa and Birnin Gwari, the Ansaru presence is still there; nobody knows their motive. In some areas, the Ansaru are patrolling the roads and you will see them with their arms and even the military fatigues.
“If you go from Maganda in Birni Gwari Local Government Area to old Birnin Gwari up to Funtua, you will see these people…”
“The Ansaru is in charge on these roads and if they spot any armed bandit…any Fulani bandit they chase them away. That road is more secured than the Kaduna to Birnin Gwari Road because the Ansaru is in charge.”
Abdurra’uf stated that the Ansaru operatives are prominent in the “eastern part of Birnin Gwari and some parts of Giwa Local Government Area, notably in 6 wards Kidandan, Galadimawa, Katarge, Yaka Wada, extending to Bangoya.”
