Oromidayo, a civil engineering student, died in the process; Aramide, a business administration student drifted into a coma.
“He is in my Faculty. Yesterday was supposed to be the day we start our examinations but the school was closed down. There was protest yesterday; so he and his girlfriend went back home. They drugged themselves and started having sex,’ a neighbour of Oromdayo’s told Sahara Reporters.
