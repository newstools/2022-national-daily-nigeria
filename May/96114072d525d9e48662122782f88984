A Nigerian human rights activist, pro-democracy campaigner, and founder of an online news agency Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore has mocked the presidential hopeful who defects from PDP recently.
Omoyele Sowore is a 2023 Nigerian presidential candidate for the African Action Congress party and was previously the flag bearer in the year 2019 general election.
Peter Obi who was aspiring for the office of President on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dumped the party to another party to vie for the presidential office.
Sowore took to his Facebook page to mock the presidential hopeful, Peter Obi who dumped the PDP by asserting that the new developments within the party made it impossible for him to continue participating and making constructive quotas.
“Peter Obi has dumped rogue PDP. He’s reportedly heading to join rogue Labour leaders at the Labour Party. From APGA to PDP and now possibly to LP”, Sowore mocked.
Though many Nigerians were not happy with Peter Obi’s defection while some see it as the best decision ever, the human rights activist has mocked him, seeing Peter Obi’s defection from PDP as an irrational decision.
