Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State on Drainage and Water Resources, Mr Joe Igbokwe, who is also the former spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress in Lagos state, in an interview with Punch has revealed what he would do, if he was the vice president and he was to contest against Chief Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
While he was talking, Joe Igbokwe claimed that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo both have the right to contest under the Nigerian Constitution, as he also said that the duo were his political leaders but, Asiwaju Tinubu is the leader of all of them including the Vice President because, he was the one that supported them in politics and also gave them substantial positions.
Talking further, Joe Igbokwe said because of this, he would not have contested against Asiwaju Bola Tinubu because of what he has done for him but, also claimed that there are some people behind the Vice President who pushed him to contest against his master.
