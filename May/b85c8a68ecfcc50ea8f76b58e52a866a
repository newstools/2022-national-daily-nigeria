A federal court in Egypt has sentenced a former presidential candidate, Abdel Moneim Aboul-Fotouh, to 15 years imprisonment being convicted of “spreading false news” and “incitement against state institutions.”
Judicial sources in the country disclosed that Aboul-Foutouh, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood and the leader of the opposition Misr al-Qawia and 25 others were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment by the court.
Also, Mahmoud Ezzat, former leader of the Brotherhood, already serving multiple life sentences on other charges, was sentenced to more 15 years prison terms. The court sentenced Misr al-Qawia, deputy head of Mohammed Qassas to 10 years jail term.
It will be recalled that the Egyptian authorities arrested Aboul-Fotouh, 71, in 2018 for leading the boycott of the presidential election in the year, won  by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
