Social media critic and activist, Deji Adeyanju recently took to his Facebook page to share with Nigerians that if they knew about the money being shared among delegates they will feel sorry. Deji Adeyanju said,
“Is Nigeria now up for sale? If you hear the dollars these guys going up and down the country in the name of presidential ambitions are sharing to party members, delegates, traditional rulers, etc, you will feel sorry for this nation. Yet Nigeria is broke but people are buying N100m forms to govern a broke country. Gosh! ”
Deji is a social media critic that might have facts about this allegation he leveled on presidential aspirants that are moving from one state to another canvassing votes from party delegates and stakeholders. According to Deji, the aspirants also share a lot of dollars to the delegates so that they will vote for them.
Does that mean the presidential primaries will be about the highest bidders in the party? Does it mean that the dollarization of elections has not stopped in Nigeria? If this is true, Nigeria still has a long way to go to achieve stabilization in its democracy.
