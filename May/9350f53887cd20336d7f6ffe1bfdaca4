The Chieftain of the All Progressive Congress, Femi Fani-Kayode has taken to his official Facebook page to address several red lines that must not be crossed in Christianity. Recall that the death of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level Home Economics Student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, who was killed for alleged blasphemy has brought about several lectures from religious leaders and well-informed Nigerians on why people should not be killed for not believing in what others believed in.

Just some days ago, Aisha Yesufu, a renowned human rights activist and co-convener of Bring Back Our Girls Campaign took to her YouTube channel to say that as a Muslim, she believes that Jesus (Prophet Yisa) is a prophet and not God, and despite her believe, Christians did not kill her. However, Femi Fani-Kayode has taken to his Facebook page to address this notion.

According to him, he made it known that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and an incarnate of God who came down in the flesh to atone for our sins. He made it known that many people do cross the red line of Christians when they refer to Jesus as a Prophet but yet we take it in our stride, adding that it does not mean that the lack of understanding of the Christian belief does not hurt Christians. He said, “We don’t kill and we don’t threaten to kill because of it and neither do we show our pain when others deny Him”.
