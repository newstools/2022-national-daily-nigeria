Gumi stated that Holy Prophet Muhammad never killed anyone despite insults by non-Muslims.
He made the comment at a religious teaching in his Juma’at mosque in Kaduna.
In the message translated by PRNigeria, Gumi said the best way Muslims can prove their love for the Prophet is adherence to his words.
“Anyone who kills a non-Muslim, who they have agreed to live peacefully with, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise for 40 years,” he said.
The Sheikh explained that Islam doesn’t allow anyone to take laws into their hands and warned Islamic leaders against instigating their followers.
“If we think by killing Deborah, people who are not of the same faith with us will stop insulting our prophet, then we are in delusion”, he added.
