Nigerian singer, Falz has reacted to CBN governor, Mr. Emefiele’s request to continue as CBN Governor while he contests for the 2023 Presidential election.
According to Falz, It is hard to believe that Godwin Emefiele wrote to the court to plead for him to continue with his duties as CBN Governor and also Run for 2023 President. He added that this is one of the reasons why the country hasn’t moved forward because our leaders are greedy.
For those wondering, Emefiele finally made his declaration to run for the 2023 Presidency on Saturday, May 7 after all the hush-hush and rumors. His declaration stirred controversy with many asking him to resign if he wants to contest for the Presidential election.
Godwin Emefiele asked a court to declare that he can contest for the presidential ticket of any political party and INEC should permit him while he continue to sits as the Governor of CBN. The Federal Court rejected Emefiele’s requests to stop INEC from disqualifying him for the 2023 election.
