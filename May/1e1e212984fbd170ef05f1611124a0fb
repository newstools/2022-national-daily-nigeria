Brume was seen crying in a new video released by the terrorists on Monday. She was with other victims who had been kidnapped since March 28, 2022.
She said, “I’m pleading particularly with Professor Yemi Osinbajo, who was my classmate, Law school, 78/79. You’re a grandfather, you are a father, please come to our aid.
“We have been here for 62 days. I have a son who is a ‘sickler’ and I don’t know his condition. I’m pleading that the Federal Government and Amaechi, who is the Minister of Transportation should come to our aid. I’m pleading. We are all sick.”
Amaechi has since resigned his ministerial appointment to pursue his presidential ambition.
