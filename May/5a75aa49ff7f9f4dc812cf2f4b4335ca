It is a part of the Badagry division of Lagos state.
Adeyanju has been in the news since he initiated his London-to-Lagos bike ride to raise funds for charity.

Earlier, Adeyanju had narrated his near-death experience in Mauritius.
He had revealed how he became unsettled after he ran out of water and could not think straight.
The biker said he started hallucinating while his vision became blurred before help eventually came his way.
“Ordinarily, when you’re on this kind of trip, you don’t drink when you’re thirsty, you drink before you’re thirsty. So, when I started the ride, I was drinking whenever I’m thirsty,” he had stated.
“By the time I felt my water ration, I was with less than one litre left. Then I remembered I was doing it wrong when I  started taking water. Funny enough, I ran out of water. Then I decided to manage and continue with the journey.
“At some point, whenever I look ahead of me, it would seem that I saw someone coming towards me, but when I get there, I won’t see anyone.
“Then, it occurred to me that I have started hallucinating so I drastically brought my speed down.
