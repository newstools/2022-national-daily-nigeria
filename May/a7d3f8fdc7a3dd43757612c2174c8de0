Serhiy Hayday, the Head of Luhansk region military administration, says that Russian troops now control most of the city of Severodonetsk — but he has dismissed suggestions that Ukrainian troops in the area will be surrounded.
“We are constantly communicating,” he said. “There is an opportunity to maneuver, so the military is now calmly holding the defense in the positions they occupy now. The city at this stage has 90% of all houses damaged. Of these, 60% are almost impossible to restore. And all the critical infrastructure is completely destroyed.”
Hayday said: “Now there is no possibility to leave Severodonetsk. It’s very risky and the chances are very small to actually escape [unharmed]. Therefore, there is simply no point in risking people’s lives.”
Hayday added that the Russian goal was to surround all our troops. Of course, they would like to capture the entire Luhansk region much faster. Or just cut the route “Lysychansk – Bakhmut” or capture Severodonetsk as soon as possible. But they do not manage to capture the whole area.”
