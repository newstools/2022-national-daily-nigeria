Popular human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, took to his Facebook page to make an analysis of the most likely candidate to emerge as the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate ahead of the party primaries scheduled to hold later this month.

In a post he made, he stated that he thinks Peter Obi should leave the PDP and join another party so that he can run on their platform as it is possible that he might not emerge as the candidate of the party.

Deji Adeyanju revealed that the three main candidates in the PDP according to the strength of their delegates are Atiku Abubakar, Nyesom Wike, and Aminu Tambuwal. After the party primaries, one of the aforementioned politicians will emerge as the candidate of the PDP.
Deji Adeyanju alleged that the party governors want either Governor Wike or Governor Tambuwal to emerge so that they can team up against Atiku Abubakar at the end. This leaves Peter Obi at a disadvantage even though he is the best option for PDP because he is the most popular candidate in the country at the moment.
Deji Adeyanju advised that Peter Obi should consider switching to another party if he doesn’t get the ticket to run under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) after the forthcoming primary elections. See his post below.
