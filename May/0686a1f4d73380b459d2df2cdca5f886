Peter Albert, an unsuccessful internet fraudster, said he was introduced to the alfa by a friend—David.
Araokanmi promised the chairman he gave Peter would work but the internet fraudster must pay up the due—N200,000 or else he would die.
Tayo said his son confess to him before he died, and he got more detail from his Whatsapp chats with the alfa.
In the petition to the Commander of Ota Area Command of Ogun State Police Command, the bereaved father alleged that his son ran mad shortly after he underwent the money rituals performed on him by Alfa Araokanmi
“The said Alfa Abdulrasaq (Araokanmi) demanded the sum of N200,000 to prepare a concoction and gave it to Mr. Peter Albert to drink, that it would solve all his poverty in this world,” the petition stated.
“The said Alfa Abadulrasaq (Araokanmi) asked the late Mr. Peter to bring the money in full, (and that) any part payment would lead to his untimely death.”
Peter eventually died in Alfa Araokanmi’s hands.
“The late Mr. Peter Albert took the medicine and ran mad. But before his madness, he confessed that he was unable to complete the payment of the sum of N200,000 (and that) he saw Alfa Abdulrasaq Araokanmi with arms and ammunition which he eventually used on him that led to his death on the 6th of March, 2022,”
