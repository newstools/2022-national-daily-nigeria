CBN Gov. Godwin Emefiele has now become the latest contender for the APC flag in the 2023 presidential election.
Emefiele picked the N100 million forms from the party’s organising secretary at the International Conference Centre (ICC) in Abuja, on Friday morning.
Speculations ran wide earlier about the top banker joining his kinsmen from the southeast to scramble for the ticket after spending about eight years as CBN governor.
APC now has 25 contestants duking it out by May ending.
