Bukar was jailed on Monday, May 23, 2022 after pleading guilty to one-count charge bordering on stealing, upon being arraigned by the Gombe Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.
The one-count charge read: “That you, Bakura Goni Bukar and Ibrahim Usman (still at large) on or about 2nd May, 2019, in Gombe, Gombe State, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did commit theft of N100,000.00 (One Hundred Thousand Naira) being the property of Mohammed Abubakar Sahabi, the money, which you dishonestly and without the consent of the said Mohammed Abubakar Sahabi, transferred out of his First Bank Plc account No. 3044710342 and subsequently withdrew using your Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) card from your account No. 0097623499 domiciled at Access Bank Plc account, an offence punishable under the provision of Section 287 of the Penal Code Law of Gombe State”.
The charge was read to the defendant and he pleaded guilty to it.
In view of his plea, prosecution counsel, M. D. Aliyu, prayed the court to convict the defendant accordingly. Defence counsel, Raphael Obotidem, however urged the court to temper justice with mercy.
