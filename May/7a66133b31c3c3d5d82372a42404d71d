Engineer Joe Igbokwe was on his Facebook account to sarcastically question the list of richest Nigerians published by Forbes.
In the list shared by Joe Igbokwe, the richest Nigerian as we all know is Aliko Dangote, followed by Mike Adenuga, then Femi Otedola emerged as the third richest Nigerian, the list continued till it got to the name of the 20th richest Nigerian. Surprisingly for Joe Igbokwe the name of Bola Ahmed Tinubu could not be found in the list. So he took to his Facebook account to sarcastically express his displeasure.
I think Joe Igbokwe is doing this to spite those that usually accuse Bola Tinubu of controlling the resources of Lagos State, he might be doing this to let those set of people know that if Tinubu is as rich as they claim why is his name not in the list below. This is actually a good question Joe Igbokwe has asked here, because the way some people describe Tinubu’s wealth one would think he is the richest man in Africa.
