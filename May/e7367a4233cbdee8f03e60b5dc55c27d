The new find came after Idris pointed out some top government officials allegedly involved in some transactions.
Among them is a Permanent Secretary the EFCC has interrogated, while closing in on another one, a minister.
Idris who was arrested after he shunned 80 invitations by the EFCC, has also reportedly made a commitment to the EFCC to refund some cash to the coffers of the government.
“So far, the EFCC chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa and his team have made substantial progress,”  a source told the Nation.
“This is one of the biggest scandals that Bawa’s administration has uncovered.
“Based on preliminary investigation, the suspended AGF now will account for N170billion. Detectives are still digging more into his activities in office.
“Since his arrest on May 16th, he has made useful disclosures including some suspicious accounts and transactions.”
The suspended Accountant-General has also reportedly made available a list of government officials who had financial activities with his office.
