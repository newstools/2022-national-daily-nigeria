Ukraine military authorities have claimed Moscow’s losses amounted to 26,000 soldiers, including some 350 in the past 24 hours.
Since the invasion began on February 24, Russian forces have also lost 1,170 tanks, 2,808 armored vehicles, 199 planes and 158 helicopters, the General Staff of Armed Forces said on Facebook on Tuesday.
According to the post, the figures are “being updated” because of ongoing hostilities.
Ukraine’s allies, especially the UK recently put the losses way below 20,000, though.
Russia’s most recent death toll in late March was more than 1,300 servicemen.
