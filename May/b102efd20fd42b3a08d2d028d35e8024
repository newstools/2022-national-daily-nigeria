The President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, on Tuesday declined to join the 2023 presidential election in Nigeria. The former Minister of Agriculture had commended those who find him worthy to govern the country, and subsequently, proceeded to purchase the N100 million Expression of Interest and Nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to drag him into the presidential race.
Dr Adesina in a statement on Tuesday, declared: “I am very touched by all who have gone to great extent, with such huge sacrifices, of their own volition, to consider me worthy to be proposed for potential consideration. The coalition groups of youth, women, farmers, physically challenged and well-meaning Nigerians that have done this have expressed their genuine free will, political right, freedom of expression and association for mu consideration, with the interest of Nigeria at heart.
“While I am deeply honoured, humbled, and grateful for all the incredible goodwill, kindness, and confidence, my current responsibilities at this time do not allow me to accept to be considered.
“I remain fully engaged and committed to the mission that Nigeria, Africa, and all the non-African shareholders of the African Development Bank have given me for Africa’s development.
“I remain fully focused on the mission of supporting the accelerated development and economic integration of Africa.”
