The regional Governor of Belgorod on Sunday raised alarm that of a fire outbreak at a Russian defence ministry site in Belgorod, adjacent to the border with Ukraine. He said that one person was injured.
The Governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, wrote on Telegram: “On the borders of three municipalities — Borisov, Belgorod and the urban district of Yakovlevsky — a fire broke out at one of the defence ministry’s facilities.”
Gladkov further disclosed that one person suffered minor injuries. He, however, said that rescue services were at the scene.
Governor of another border region, Kursk, had earlier on Sunday said through Telegram that part of a railway bridge used by freight collapsed, without causing any casualties.
According to Governor Roman Starovoyt: “It was sabotage, a criminal case has been opened. The authorities in charge of the investigation will resolve the issue.” He did not mention Ukrainian forces, anyway, but promised more information later.
Russia had several times accused Ukrainian forces of attacks on Russian territory, in areas close to the border with Ukraine.
