Nigerian Music artiste, Peter Okoye has taken to his official Twitter handle @PeterPsquare to speak about the candidates that have signalled their interest to run for the presidency in 2023. According to him, only one candidate is overqualified to become the successor of President Muhammadu Buhari when he leaves Aso Rock, Nigeria’s citadel of power.
So many big wigs have signalled their interest to run and they are already voicing out what they intend to do if they win. However, Peter Okoye didn’t reveal the name of the candidate he thinks is the most qualified and his tweet has kept his followers puzzled, and it has sparked mixed reactions on Twitter.
He wrote;
“So far!…. Only one candidate is over Qualified to be Nigeria’s Next President!”
The likes of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, Yahaya Bello, Rochas Okorocha, Peter Obi, David Umahi, Yemi Osinbajo, Godwin Emefiele, Nyesom Wike, Bukola Saraki, Orji Uzor Kalu, Aminu Tambuwal, Rotimi Amaechi and so many others are all championing one course and at the end of it all, only one candidate would emerge as the winner.
