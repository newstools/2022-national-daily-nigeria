A few days after Real Madrid got crowned the Champions Of Europe after winning its 14th UCL title, the best players for the 2021/2022 season were announced. Similarly, the team of the tournament was announced.

Note that Vinicius was named the best young player of the tournament, while Karim Benzema was named the Player of the tournament. However, fans have been reacting after the UCL team of the season was announced.

1. The Inclusion Of Kylian Mbappe Ahead Of Other Players Raises Questions.
Note that Kylian Mbappe had a great season, but his team got knocked out in the round of 16. Note that Kylian Mbappe didn’t have much impact as players like Salah, Lewandowski, and Haller, who were ignored. Haller scored 11 goals, Lewandowski scored 13 goals, and Salah scored 8 goals, while Mbappe scored only 6 goals.

Secondly, Lewandowski still managed to take Bayern Munich to the quarter-final, while Salah helped Liverpool reach the final. Also, Mohamed Salah’s contribution to his team in the final against Real Madrid shows that he should have been included in the team of the season ahead of Kylian Mbappe, who got knocked out in the round of 16.
