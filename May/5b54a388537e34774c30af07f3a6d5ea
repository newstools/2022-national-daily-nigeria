The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has said its members will cancel and reschedule flights due to scarcity of aviation fuel.
The body, in a release made on Monday by Obiora Okonkwo, its spokesman, said the effects of the scarcity were negatively affecting flight operations in the country.
In the release, AON lamented the implications of the rising cost on airline operations.
The statement read in part, “The Airline Operators of Nigeria wishes to alert the public of impending disruptions to scheduled flight operations of members of the association. This development is being forced on members by the growing scarcity of aviation fuel popular as Jet-Al.

“The scarcity is impacting negatively on the seamless conduct of air transport operations and would lead to flight rescheduling, and, or, cancellations.
“However, the association and its members are working very hard, and in alliance with product marketers, government and relevant stakeholders, to ensure availability and proper pricing of aviation fuel in the country.
“While pleading the understanding of the flying public in the face of this reality, we also promise to do all that is necessary, and within our powers, to restore normal flight schedules as soon as possible.”
