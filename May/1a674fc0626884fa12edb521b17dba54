The petition alleges that Heard, 36, has been “exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp” during their ongoing multimillion-dollar court battle.
The petition on Change.org was created by Jeanne Larson in late 2020, following news that Depp, 58, was asked to step down from his role of Gellert Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts franchise.
The defamation trial involving Heard and Depp is set to continue next week.
