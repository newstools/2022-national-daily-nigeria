Former Presidential Aspirant, Adamu Garba II has knocked the governor of Kaduna State, Governor El-Rufai over his January 2013 comment on Jesus Christ. Recall that there has been a thug of religious validations going on online since the gruesome death of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level Home Economics Student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, who was killed for blasphemy.
However, while Adamu Garba II was cautioning Christians to avoid the red line of Muslims, one of his followers replied with a statement Governor El-Rufai, made against Jesus Christ in 2013. While responding to it, Adamu Garba II condemned the statement of the Governor. According to him, he said;
”For those making this reference. Quiet alright, Gov. Elrufai was very wrong and extreme in his analogy here. I don’t think any responsible Muslim will ever support this. Ask around!
“We must avoid unnecessarily heating this topic on the issue that is plain for all to see.”
