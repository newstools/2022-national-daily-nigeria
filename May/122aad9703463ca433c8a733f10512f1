Senator Shehu Sani who formerly represented the Kaduna central senatorial district has come out to hit at some muslim politicians who allegedly pasted their campaign posters in the Holy City of Mecca during the fasting period.

The former Senator took to his official twitter page to warned that those displaying or pasting campaign posters are not there for religious purposes. He says the Hajj commission should take note and ban those involved for ten years.
Check out his post belowSen Shehu Sani is not impressed with the fact that some muslim political figures could post campaign posters in the Holy City. The Ramadan is a time when when Muslims are expected to observe the fast and be sober, making sure they do the right thing. They should not use the same time to campaign or spread their political posters, especially in Mecca. They are there for a purely religious purpose and they should not mix their faith with politics.
Shehu Sani is asking the Hajj commission to fish out anyone involved and also ban them from traveling to the Holy City for ten years.
