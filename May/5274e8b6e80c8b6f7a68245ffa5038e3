Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Governors Aminu Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed met overnight to determine the possibility of a consensus among them.
The effort failed.
The four northern insisted of contesting in the primary already going at the MKO Abiola Stadium Square, Abuja.
However, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen agreed to withdraw, and later cited monetization of primaries as one of the reasons.
But party sources are hinting about surprises—like the south-south aspirant Nyesom Wike winning the primary.
The aspirants are in last-minute consultation with other aspirants and delegates with hope that the pendulum will swing their way.
