A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abdulmumin Jibrin, has announced plans to quit the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
Jibrin, who represented Kiru/Bebeji federal constituency of Kano State, was lately an ardent supporter of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s presidential aspiration.
The former federal lawmaker, who took to his verified Twitter handle on Saturday evening, said he has done his best for APC and it was time to move on, promising to announce his new political party in the next 24 hours.

Abdulmumin Jibrin has announced his defection from the ruling All Progressive Congress, although the campaign chief for Bola Tinubu has yet to announce his next political party.
“I have done my best for APC,” Mr Jibrin said on Twitter Saturday. “It’s time to move on. I will announce my new political party within the next 24 hours insha Allah. I will make a formal statement in due course.”
The former House appropriation committee chairman has been leading support groups for Mr Tinubu across northern Nigeria. It was not immediately clear why he decided to leave the ruling party, but concerns have mounted in recent weeks that the APC might allow northern candidates to contest its ticket.
