Sagay, a constitutional lawyer and the head of an anti-corruption committee, was quoted as saying that the number of APC presidential candidates who have expressed interest in running for president has now become “theatre of the absurd”.
It was a joke gone too far, he said, when the governor of Nigeria’s Central Bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, announced his intention to run for president. According to him, Emefiele would not be chosen by APC delegates in the primary election since so many candidates have joined up to compete for president. He further asserted that others are plotting to grab control of the government.
A strong indication of his displeasure was his choice to oppose Godwin Emefiele’s candidacy in the primaries. The nomination procedure for the APC is like an absurdist play. According to the speaker, some northerners are working to ensure that the next president elected from the southern portion of the country does not serve more than four years in office.
