Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has shed more light on how he became the vice president, according to him, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu did not want him to become Muhammadu Buhari’s running mate in 2015 because he wants the position of vice president for himself. Osinbajo revealed that only Aregbesola and Bisi Akande supported him to become the vice president.
He added that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is a self-centred man and that is why anyone who truly knows him will be aware that he is a dictator. Yemi Osinbajo noted that another reason why he was able to become the vice president was that Muhammadu Buhari declined to have a Muslim-Muslim ticket, and since Tinubu was a Muslim he was struck out.

He said, Tinubu had the intention to become president since he knew him, and such desperation means he can do anything to make sure he emerges. Yemi Osinbajo added that he is not discrediting him, but Tinubu will bring more woes to Nigeria if he emerges, and in case he does not emerge as the next president he will still emphasize that Tinubu might not be the best candidate we need now.
His statement was reportedly made to disclaim rumours that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu made him the Vice President, so he owes Tinubu his loyalty in the 2023 presidential elections.
