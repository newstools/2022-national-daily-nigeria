According to the governor, the decision was taken after wide consultations with stakeholders across the country.
The battle among the northern aspirants now remains among Atiku, Bauchi Gov. Mohammed Bala, and former Sen. President Bukla Saraki.
The four were deadlocked earlier today after series of horsetrading that started Friday night.
But the PDP stakeholders appealed to the northern aspirants to choose a consensus to battle aspirants from the south, including Rivers Gov. Nyesom Wike, former Gov. Ayo Fayose and four others.
Mohammed Hayatu-Deen was the first to pull out of the race.
