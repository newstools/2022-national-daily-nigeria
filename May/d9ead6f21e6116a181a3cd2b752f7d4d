Reno Omokri took to his Facebook page to react to news of the beheading of one honorable Okechukwu Okoye by unknown assailants in Anambra state. According to him, the act is a barbaric act that should not be happening in any society.
Reno Omokri recalled that, first, it was the military couple that got beheaded in the country, the news that the citizens haven’t recovered from, and now honorable Okoye has also fallen victim.
He stated that this level of criminality is strange to the shores of Nigeria, and we must not allow it to take root. He advised that all Nigerians should unite and fish out the people behind this evil act, as the authorities should punish them ruthlessly and speedily.

Reno Omokri advised that we must not allow Nigeria to descend so low that gruesome murder no longer shocks us, as we must be very shocked that things like this are happening.

According to him, there has been too much impunity in Nigeria, which has created a fertile ground for these heinous crimes to be perpetrated with such regularity. He stated that this kind of incident is enough because we don’t know who is next if we don’t put a stop to this madness. He extended his condolences to the family and community of the deceased.
