Political parties in Nigeria under the aegis of Intra Party Advisory Council (IPAC), at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Quarterly Consultative Meeting with Political Party Executives in Abuja on Tuesday, demanded adjustment of the date for party primaries by the INEC.
Chairman of IPAC, a body of the 18 registered political parties in Nigeria, Yusuf Yabagi-Sani, National Chairman Africa Democratic Party (ADP), urged INEC to make the adjustment, which he said, should affect party Primaries by two months only, and will not alter the timeline for the 2023 general elections.

The INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, turned down the request,  telling leaders of political parties of importance of complying with the election timeline,  which he said, is a constitutional matter.
