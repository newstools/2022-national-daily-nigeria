A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Mr. Reno Omokri recently took to his social media page to criticize fellow activists that were silent on the gruesome murder of Fatimah and her 4 children by IPOB-linked terrorist group in Anambra State, Reno Omokri said.
“This is a photo of Harira (not Fatima as was previously thought) and her 4 children. Look at them. They were apolitical. They were concerned with making a living. Until there were brutally gunned down by unknown gunmen in Anambra on Sunday, May 22, 2022. And now, those who condemned Deborah’s murder are silent. They can no longer talk. This death is not condemnable to them for some strange reason. Now, known activists have become unknown activists.”
