Recall that Pope Francis had earlier had an interview with Luciano Fontana, the editor of a famous Italian newspaper during which he spoke extensively about the war in Ukraine. The Pope also revealed that he was willing to visit Ukraine but before doing that, he will visit Russia first. Speaking further, Pope Francis hinted that NATO may have caused the war in Ukraine by “barking at Putin’s door”
FFK believes the Pope is right as he says he spoke the bitter truth. He says Ukraine is paying the price for their reckless miscalculations and grave mistake and that soon, NATO may also pay the price.
