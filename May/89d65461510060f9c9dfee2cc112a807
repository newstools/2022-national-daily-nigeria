Over 100 motorcyclists have attacked Same Global Estate in the Lokogoma area of Abuja to avenge the death of two colleagues who were allegedly hit by a car on Sunday and ran into the estate for safety.
Residents of the estate said two buildings were set ablaze by the rampaging Okada riders in their bid to apprehend the unknown motorist.
They noted that the motorist was chased by a mammoth crowd of motorcyclists after he overran two motorcyclists.
The Estate Manager, Mr. Adebisi Adelowo said, “Over 100 Hausa bike riders attacked our estate some hours ago. They tried to burn down the estate by putting fire on two buildings.
“They pulled down our gate and started stoning people’s houses. We couldn’t stop them until the police and the army intervened.
“We later learned that they attacked our estate because two of their colleagues were knocked to death by a motorist who ran to our estate for safety as he was being chased with big stones and other dangerous weapons.
“The motorist who is not even a resident of our estate ran into the estate because he noticed a police post in front of the estate.”
