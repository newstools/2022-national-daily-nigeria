Omoyele Sowore, one of 2023 Presidential Aspirants has taken to his official Twitter handle to knock Ahmed Idris, the Accountant General of the Federation for being accused of stealing N80billion through illegal means.
According to multiple reports, the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris was picked up by operatives of the Economic Financial Crime Commission, EFCC after he failed to honour the invitation of the commission to respond to how the money went missing. It was gathered that the money was invested into real estate in Kano and Abuja using proxies, family members, and close associates.
While reacting to this, Omoyele Sowore reported the incident, adding that if requests to increase the minimum wage are made, economists would say that it would cause inflation.
However, Nigerians on twitter have condemned the action, noting that such money laundering at this crucial time when the economy of the country seems terrible is nothing short of a sad situation. See some of the reactions below;
