The former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, on Wednesday morning wiredrew from the PDP governorship primary election in Enugu State. The Director General of the Ike Ekweremadu Campaign Organisation, Charles Ogbo Asogwa,  in a statement on Wednesday morning titled:  “Senator Ekweremadu will not participate in PDP primary election” appealed to the former Deputy Senate President’s supporters to remain over the decision.
The DG commended the supporters and the people of Enugu State for the Goodwill they have shown to DSP Ekweremadu on his ambition for a “pathway to a New Enugu State”.
The campaign organization did not give any reason for the withdrawal of the  Senator from the PDP primary in Enugu State holding on Wednesday, May 25, 2022.
There were indications that the withdrawal from the governorship race may not be unconnected with the issue of zoning, which many believe did not favour Ekweremadu in the Enugu governorship race.
A former Governor of the old Anambra State, Jim Nwobodo, had earlier declared support for Dr. Peter Mbah as PDP candidate in Enugu State for the 2023 governorship election.  Nwobodo had on Tuesday said that Enugu East Senatorial Zone had endorsed Dr. Peter Mbah as the PDP candidate in the state.
Earlier, a former PDP national chairman, Okwesilieze Nwodo, had declared that the zoning arrangement in Enugu State must be sustained, saying that it is the turn of Enugu East to produce the next governor in the state.
