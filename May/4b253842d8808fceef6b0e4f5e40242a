Babajide Kolade Otitoju and other journalists were reacting to Governor Soludo’s visit to Nnamdi Kanu, they commended the governor for doing the unexpected and Babajide Otitoju proposed a solution to the sit at home order that is affecting the economy of the south east region. Read what Babajide Kolade Otitoju said about the sit at home below.
“It is a good thing governor Soludo sought audience with Nnamdi Kanu, i could see from the pictures that Nnamdi Kanu was excited and happy to have Soludo visit him, don’t forget that Soludo has joined others in the past to seek freedom for Nnamdi Kanu, so Nnamdi Kanu was happy to receive him. Now, the governor said Nnamdi Kanu was not happy with the killings going on in the south east, the governor said Nnamdi Kanu will not be averse to a situation were he would be able to address the people in this matter. Maybe what needs to be done is for Nnamdi Kanu to be allowed to shoot a video were he would appeal to the people saying he is not in support of this crippling sit at home that is affecting the socio-economic potential of the south east, maybe if that can be done and it is pushed out maybe that would put an end to this needless sit at home that is going on and the Killings and attack going on.
Government institutions are being destroyed, so somebody needs to put an end to this carnage in the south east and that is why some of us have called for peaceful dialogue in this matter, it is not every matter that the court would resolve. I expect Nigerian government to respond to the clamour for dialogue to be used to resolve this matter”.
