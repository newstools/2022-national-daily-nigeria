A remarkable Yoruba cultural association, Afenifere, has expressed insistence on the zoning of the presidential ticket to Southeast Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.
A leader of Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo, in Ogun State on Sunday, declared that the presidency should be zoned to the southeast in the spirit of fairness and equity. He stated that the zoning of the presidential ticket to southeast Nigeria will bring about inclusiveness in the running of the country. According to Adebanjo, “If you want peace, you must have equity.”
The Afenifere leader emphasized that after Southwest has had its turn producing former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the south-south having former President Goodluck Jonathan, the Southeast should take its turn to produce the president in 2023.
Adebanjo had protested: “Is Southeast not in the south? Is it not in Nigeria?
“It is because of this inclusiveness we put federal character in the constitution.”
