Leaders of the all progressive congress (APC) in the southwestern region, have set aside the issue of consensus at the meeting they had with aspirants from the region yesterday.
A source who disclosed the information said that a leader had asked if any of the aspirants could step down to ensure that the region gets the presidential ticket. However, no one responded to the question, which was why it was set aside. He also said the leaders had called the meeting to encourage the aspirants, and to caution them on utterances.
The number of aspirants under the platform had been threatening to the southwestern region of the country, which would require an agreement between aspirants from the region to win the party’s ticket. However, you will agree that one would ask any of the aspirants who had paid N100million for forms to step down for another. All aspirants would test their popularity in the party’s primary election, which had been scheduled to hold on the 30th of May, 2022.
The leaders had prohibited personal attacks by aspirants, during and after the election. They had asked the aspirants to support whoever emerges candidate of the party. The leaders had also asked the aspirants to ensure that the ticket goes to the southwest.
The source said, “Funnily enough, the issue of consensus was not listed in the agenda of the meeting. It was also not part of the text messages sent to us for the meeting. The meeting was majorly concerned about the utterances that had already been portraying us as divided, and that the zone was behaving as if we had no leader.”
