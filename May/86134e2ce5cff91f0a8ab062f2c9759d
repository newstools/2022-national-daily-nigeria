Tragedy struck Sunday night, in Jakande Estate, Oke-Afa, Isolo area of Lagos, where two lovers were found dead inside a Highlander SUV.
The man, an information technology engineer identified simply as Koyejo, was found in his nude while the lady, whose identity could not be immediately ascertained, was half naked.
Residents told our source that the SUV with number plate EPE 666 GE, was sighted on Saturday night at Double Star bus-stop, but they became curious when the car, which ignition was on, remained at the same spot on Sunday night.
Suspecting it could have been stolen, some youths were said to have flashed a torchlight inside the SUV with tinted glass, only to discover the bodies.
One of the residents, who spoke said: “Koyejo lived at Double Star before he moved to Surulere area of Lagos with his family. He was an IT engineer. He called one of us to inform us that he was in the estate on Saturday.
“We were told he went to pick his girlfriend at Isolo on Saturday night. They went to Moshalashi bus stop to buy suya and took some bottles of alcoholic drinks.”
When Policemen from Ejigbo, who were alerted, arrived at the scene, the side door behind the driver’s seat was the only door opened, while others remained locked.
Late Koyejo’s body was already peeling.
