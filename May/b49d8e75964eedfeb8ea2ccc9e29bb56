Congratulations have been pouring in for the former Vice President and presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, after he emerged as the winner in the just concluded PDP’s presidential primary, and one of those who have extended congratulations to him is the former Special Adviser to Kano State Governor, Salihu Yakassai.
In the post he made on his verified Twitter handle, Salihu, who is known on Twitter as Dawisu, advised Atiku to wait and see the region the flag bearer of APC will come from before he chooses his running mate.
He said that if APC betrays the South-West and does not give the ticket to someone from there, then Atiku should pick a Yoruba person as his running mate, but if APC gives the ticket to South-West, then Atiku should pick his running mate from South-South. He believes that the strategy will win Atiku the support of other regions outside the North.
He wrote – “Congratulations Wazirin Duk Duniya. Your tenacity and resilience are unparalleled. My advice? Choose carefully who your running mate should be. Hold on till after the APC primaries. If they betray the South-West, pick from there. If they give it to South-West, go with South-South.”
In 2019, Atiku Abubakar had picked his running mate from the South-East, which was Peter Obi, but this time around, Peter Obi might not be his running mate, as the former Anambra State governor will be part of the presidential race under the umbrella of Labour Party. Salihu says that this time around, Atiku should pick his running mate from either the South-West or South-South, depending on where APC’s candidate will come from.
Which region do you want Atiku to choose his running mate from? Please feel free to share your thoughts with us.
