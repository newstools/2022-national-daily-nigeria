The Nigerian Army stated this Tueday while identifying the two solders the outlawed killed and mutilated on Saturday in Imo.
Audu Linus, a Master Warrant Officer, and Gloria Matthew, a Private , were murdered and beheaded on Saturday.
Army spokesman, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, vowed that their killers would be tracked down.
“Apparently, the soldiers had embarked on the trip to fulfill the traditional rites of conjugating their matrimony, as the very well respected and cherished Igbo tradition demands,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.
“Ironically, the fact that one of the soldiers, Pte Gloria Matthew who hails from Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo state, has an ethnic affiliation with the good people of south east Nigeria did not prevail on the sensibility of the dissidents.
“This dastardly act, one too many, clearly portends the deep-seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have being unleashing terror on Ndigbo, whom they claim they are on a mission to protect and emancipate, as well as other innocent Nigerians who are resident or transiting the South East.
“This gruesome murder, in which they did not spare even their own child, clearly depicts callousness, impenitence and is indisputably, a brazen act of terrorism perpetrated by IPOB/ESN,” the statement read.
Nwachukwu noted that the dissident groups have continued to live in denial, while masquerading as unknown gunmen in their criminal violent campaign in the region.
Accoriding to him, the Nigerian Army would ensure the perpetrators of the dastardly act unleashed on its personnel do not go unpunished,.
“While we deeply condole with the families, relations and close associates of the victims, the NA has commenced investigation to unmask and bring the criminals to book,” he said.
