Actually, he’s being true to his vow: to own no earthly possession at 50.
The decision makes sense—since Elon Musk, owner of Tesla And SpaceX,  started exploring the moon, and how human life can be replicated there.
While he sojourns here on Planet Earth, he makes do in peppercorn-rent home he got from SpaceX for $50 grand in Texas. He sold his seven mansions two years ago before moving in here.
The 50-something year-old house has a rocket-shaped kids’ playhouse and Tesla solar panels and is just a block from SpaceX Starbase and two miles from the Mexican border, according to the Daily Mail.
Neighbors also confirmed to publication that Musk lives in the three-bed, ranch-style home roofed covered with high-tech Tesla-made solar tiles, and cameras, overt and covert, installed all over the place.
Twitter is his latest addition to his dollar-grossing investment.
