There is seeming tension in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, followed up on the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) seeking party tickets for the 2023 general elections to resign with immediate effect. The SGF followed up the presidential directive at the FEC meeting on Wednesday with a memo ordering the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, ministers, including the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami SAN; the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi; the Minister of State, Uche Ogar, as well as ambassadors, heads of agencies, and other political appointees to resign as they seek the APC ticket for the 2023 elections.
Boss Mustapha in a circular on Wednesday, declared: “For the avoidance of doubt, this directive affects all Ministers, Heads, and Members of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals of Government, Ambassadors as well as other political appointees who desire to contest for elective offices.
“For smooth running of the machinery of government and our foreign Missions, affected Ministers are to hand over to Ministers of State, where they exist, or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister, Ambassadors shall hand over to their Deputy Heads of Mission or the most senior Foreign Service Officer in line with established practices.
“Similarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies, and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organization, in line with the service-wide Circular No. SGF.50/S. II/0.2/268 of 4th December 2017.”
Most ministers had gone into the race for the APC tickets for various elections retaining their offices with the intention to continue their appointments if they lose at the party primaries.
