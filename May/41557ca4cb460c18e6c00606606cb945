No fewer than 11 members defected to the party of Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso and the APC on Friday.
Ten out of the 11 hopped in from the PDP, while one jumped to the APC, stating the crisis in the PDP as his reason.
According to a statement by the Director Press and Public Affairs of the Assembly, Uba Abdullahi, the Speaker, congratulated the member for joining the APC and assured him that the party would carry him and his people along on all matters related to the Party.
However, the other 10 lawmakers also sent their respective defection letters to the Speaker.
