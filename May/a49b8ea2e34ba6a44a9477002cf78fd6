In a video now online, the actor displayed cowries, sea stones, glass, pins, bullets, and a key, and said they lodged in his heart, chest, neck and shoulder.
According to him, the key holed up in his heart, from where the prophet dug it out.
But he didn’t die, though he said he had some subterranean experience.
“At a point I was asleep, I was even seeing myself five feet under the ground,” he said.
“Once you are with God nobody can harm you.
“However powerful the person be, he cannot harm you. I see myself as an agent of the Lord.”
