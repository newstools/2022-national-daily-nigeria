It is no longer news that Nigeria’s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has bowed to pressure from political parties to extend the June 3 deadline it earlier issued for all primaries to have been conducted in the country.
Recall that on Friday, May 27, 2022, the Mahmood Yakubu-led INEC announced that it was extending the deadline by another 6 days to not only enable all political parties conclude their outstanding primaries, not to also submit names of flag bearers to the electoral body ahead of next year’s polls.
There are indications that shortly after the announcement was made, the Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held an emergency meeting to determine if whether or not it should go on with its presidential primary scheduled to take place this weekend.
The opposition party is also accusing INEC of attempting to give the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) an undue advantage through the extension.

Needless to say, the report has drawn the attention of some prominent Nigerians on social media.
Taking to his Twitter handle, Deji Adeyanju has advised the opposition party that it would be better for it to postpone its presidential primary than for it to pick the wrong flag bearer to contest against the APC at the polls.
According to him, picking the wrong aspirant will spell doom for the PDP in 2023.
