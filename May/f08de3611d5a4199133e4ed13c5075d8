Some of the officers held hostage were later released following a rapid response from the rescue team of the FCT Police Command led by Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, Bernard Igwe.
The Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah confirmed the incident.
‘’Some officials of Development Control attached to the task force who went to Gaduwa to mark illegal houses springing up indiscriminately in the community for demolition were heavily resisted and attacked by some persons wielding weapons,” he said.
He commended some youths who helped in calming the situation and facilitated the release of the hostages.
He said, “I was sent somewhere by the minister, and before I arrived the scene, the police officer who was badly injured on the head and some others had been rushed to the hospital.
“Those who were held hostage were rescued by a team led by DC Bernard Igwe. The area where the indigenous people stay was not marked. The police will determine what happens to those who were arrested.”
Kalu Amadi, among the hostages, described the experience as horrific.
Amadi was allegedly striped half naked, and nearly got killed.
