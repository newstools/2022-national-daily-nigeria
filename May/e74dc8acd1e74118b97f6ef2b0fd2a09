According to UK Telegraph, the escapologist, was involved in the accident during rehearsal
on an American version of the show in October.
Goodwin’s fiancée, Amanda Abbington, has also revealed that 42-year-old Goodwin almost died twice after the accident that saw him crushed between two suspended cars on the set of America’s Got Talent: Extreme.
The 2019 Britain’s Got Talent contestant and 2020 America’s Got Talent semi-finalist suffered a severed spinal cord and third-degree burns.
Speaking on Jay Rayner’s Out To Lunch podcast, Abbington said, “He fell 30ft and lost a kidney, broke both shoulder blades, shattered both legs. Third-degree burns, broke his spine and severed his spinal cord and nearly died. And then on the operating table, he nearly died again.”
