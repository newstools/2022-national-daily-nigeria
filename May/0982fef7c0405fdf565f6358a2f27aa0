But Deputy Gov. Benedict Alabi stood in for is boss, and welcome the vice president at the government house.
Osinbajo assured the delegates of people-oriented programmes if finally elected into the office in 2023.
“I am sure that the delegates also had a very good time interacting with me and quite interrogative about what my views are regarding the future of this country,” Osinbajo said.
Osun APC has been fragmented since the cold war between Oyetola and his predecessor and Interior Minister Rauf Aregbesola dialed up into a hot war.
Osinbajo could possibly worm himself into the hearts of the Aregbesola faction.
