Shehu Sani, a prominent Nigerian activist and former federal legislator, contends that the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, MACBAN, did not truly purchase the infamous N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms for former President Goodluck Jonathan.
According to him, the body was merely a pawn in a game of political chess. He questioned why the organisation overlooked their Fulani brother, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and decided to purchase the forms for Jonathan.
Jonathan stated that he did not sanction the acquisition of his APC presidential candidacy form by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association.
Through a statement made in Abuja by his spokesman, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president stated that he had no connection to the northern alliance that purchased the form.
He scolded those responsible for the hoax to stop defaming his name further and advised Nigerians to disregard it.
Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna central district in the 8th National Assembly, stated that “Miyetti could not have purchased a N100 million form for Goodluck Jonathan if he had not purchased an N40 million form for Fulani Atiku.”
He continued through Twitter, “They are merely pawns in a political game.”
