The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has withdrawn from the 2023 presidential race. The CBN governor who was aspiring for the APC presidential ticket also ordered the withdrawal of the suit seeking court’s clearance to contest for the APC presidential ticket in the preparations for the 2023 general elections.
Counsels to Emefiele at the resumption of proceedings at the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, on Monday, pleaded: “We shall be praying your Lordship to respectfully discontinue the suit and make an order striking out the suit.”
Emefiele was contesting the demands for his resignation from office as CBN governor before joining the presidential race. He had gone to court to seek protection but on Monday ordered the withdrawal of the suit.
President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered all appointed public officers contesting the 2023 elections to resign before participating in the party primaries. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, subsequently issued a memo reiterating the President’s order, and clarifying the categories of appointed office holders expected to resign before contesting the elections.
After the president’s directive, some ministers and other political appointees withdrew from the various race and keeping their jobs.
The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylver, are among the ministers that withdrew from the presidential race after the president’s order. The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami SAN, also withdrew from the governorship race in Kebbi State.
