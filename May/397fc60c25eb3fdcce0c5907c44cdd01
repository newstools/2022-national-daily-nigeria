That creates confusion for observers of the 2023 politics who already believe ex-Presidet Goodluck Jonathan, AfDB President Akinwunmi Adeshina, Minister Chris Ngige, and CBN Gov. Godwin Emefiele have showed no interest in the APC ticket.
But the party said the four have yet to write them officially they are pulling out, though te forms were bought by support groups for all the four except Ngige.
Frontline presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan and other 21 contenders will also appear tomorrow before the Presidential Screening Committee.
The venue of the exercise is the Conference Hall, Transcorp, Abuja, on Tuesday.
The seven-man panel set up by the National Working Committee (NWC) is made up of a member from each of the six geo-political zones.
APC National Organising Secretary Sulaiman Arugungu said the exercise was shifted from today to tomorrow in a telephone interview with our correspondent.
“As far as the party is concerned all the 28 aspirants that paid and picked the forms for the nomination as Presidential aspirants, nobody has formally written to us that he has withdrawn his aspiration,” he told the Nation.
“All the forms of the 28 aspirants will be taken to the screening committee, not tomorrow (Monday), but on Tuesday, God’s willing, at Transcop Hilton Hotel.”
“But, we have to consult with our leaders before we make it public. By tomorrow (Monday) we will know who are the panellists,” Arugungu assured.
