Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State on Drainage and Water Resources, Mr Joe Igbokwe, who is also the former spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress in Lagos state, in an interview with Punch correspondent yesterday, has spoken concerning the forthcoming presidential election.
When he was asked about other top politicians from the South West ( Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and Mr Adams Oshiomhole), who have also joined the presidential race to contest against Chief Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, despite the fact that Tinubu helped all of them, he said that they already know what would happen at the convention ground, as he said Tinubu will win 60 to 70 per cent of the total votes of the delegates.
Joe Igbokwe said, “It’s in the cart already, unless something happens.”
Going further, he said most of the presidential candidates are just showing interest because they want to remain in the system and that the title “former presidential aspirant” counts for something.
He said most of them coming out to contest are Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s political mentees and that, people should wait until they get to the bridge and cross it.
Joe Igbokwe claimed that Senator Ibikunle Amosun was in the ANPP and he contested to be the governor of Ogun State but, he was eventually defeated until he joined the All Progressives Congress and he was assisted by Tinubu. When he eventually won, he came to Tinubu’s house, carried him and started dancing around with him.
He said people like this can never disappoint Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu but, people should wait and see what will happen at the primary election.
“They are all working for Tinubu,” Joe Igbokwe says.
