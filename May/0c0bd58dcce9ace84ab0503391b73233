The former senator that represented the good people of Kaduna Central Senatorial Zone, Senator Shehu Sani, has reacted to a certain post that was made by a medical doctor who goes by the name Christopher Uche-Ayodeji.
According to the Facebook post, the man made it known that he served in the north for three months before relocating to the United Kingdom. He further stated that he had fun within these months, because he literally allowed Northern Muslims to die under his care.
He went on and stated it clearly that he was there on a revenge mission, because his street neighbour who served in Bauchi State was killed, in 2015, so he vowed to avenge her death and he eventually did it in full.
While reacting to this, Senator Shehu Sani referred to him as a confessed murderer. He went on and urged the security operatives to launch an urgent investigation and bring him to justice.
