Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a front line presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), extended his campaign for the PDP ticket to Ondo State, where he engaged the party’s delegates from the state to the national convention.
Atiku emphasized the essence of devolution of power, while engaging the delegates, noting that too much powers are concentrated at the centre.
The PDP presidential aspirant decried the ill-treatment of university teachers by the federal government. He lamented that it is sad students are kept at home for over three months due to strike and the government has done nothing. Atiku, therefore, promised to tackle the problems in the education sector if elected president in the 2023 general elections.
Atiku, soliciting the support of the Ondo delegates, urged them to be united to ensure the party’s victory in the 2023 general elections, telling the delegates that Nigerians are looking unto them and the PDP for rescue from the prevailing hardship in the country.
