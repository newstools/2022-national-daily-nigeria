He said this on Thursday evening in Abuja when he hosted the Forum of Former Deputy Governors of Nigeria (FFDGN).
“Many of you I know, and you have participated in governance and political activities. You have given value to your various states. When we merged as one and took the broom as the symbol of our party, broom has a lot of meaning,” he said.
“Let me first of all address our element of constitution. Our reward system as APC is very poor, and it was late before I could recognise that. Let me assure you, I won’t repeat that mistake, if I’m elected.
“But for those who have decided to be an opponent, I will not dwell on that. Let’s see who wins. But I want to win and I want you to work along with me and to convince more delegates.”
More than 20 aspirants, including CBN Gov Godwin Emefiele, are ready to vie for the ticket by May ending.
