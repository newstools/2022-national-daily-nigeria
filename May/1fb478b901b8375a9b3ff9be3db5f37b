Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based rights activist, has speculated on why the All Progressives Congress, APC, has yet to conduct presidential candidate screening 48 hours before the party’s primaries.
The APC, according to Adeyanju, is awaiting the results of the Peoples Democratic Party’s primaries.
According to him, the APC is concerned that the PDP may nominate a Northerner as their presidential candidate, which is why the process is taking so long.
“48 hours to APC primaries, no vetting of candidates or any clear direction since they are so frightened that the PDP will pick a Northern candidate,” Adeyanju said on Facebook.
“This is why they’re waiting and walking around in circles.” They are simply awaiting the results of the PDP primaries and will act within hours.
The APC presidential primary convention will take place on Sunday, May 29th and Monday, May 30th, 2022, as scheduled.
On May 28 and 29, the PDP will hold its presidential primary at Abuja’s Moshood Abiola Stadium.
