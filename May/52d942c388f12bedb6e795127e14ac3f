A popular Nigerian activist Aisha Yesufu, took to her social media and reacted after a man cautioned her not to interfere on Northern issues.
Recently, Aisha Yesufu was on her Twitter page, where she said that evil acts will not stop until Nigerians learn to condemn all evil. Aisha Yesufu’s statement, however, triggered a man identified as Hannie, to say that Aisha Yesufu is making a statement that will make Northerners come after her life as he noted that Aisha Yesufu is not Northern Muslim but she is interfering on issues that do not concern her.
Replying to Hannie’s statement, Aisha Yesufu said that he should not hide behind anything as she called on him to murder her instead of him waiting for others to do it for him.
According to Aisha Yesufu, she said: “Don’t hide anything, feel free to murder me instead of cowardly waiting for others to do it for you”.
Looking at what Aisha Yesufu said, she seems very angry with the man’s statement.
