The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria is yet to issue any statement over a huge damaged passenger which blocked the busy Ikeja Along road, Lagos, causing traffic gridlock
It is unclear how the plane suddenly appeared on the ever busy road, as there are different accounts about the incident.
Some have said the aircraft crash-landed on the spot, but others say it’s damaged and was being towed to the facility of nearby Federal Airport Authority (FAAN) when it got stuck on the road.
One eyewitness Mac Henry wrote on Twitter, “I just saw a plane crash around Ikeja along.”Another, Adedayo (@lollydeee) wrote: “There’s a plane on Ikeja along”.
Another user, Ms Petite, @Un_botherd, said, “I don’t know what happened but I saw the plane on my way home this evening around 7:30pm.
“It is at Ikeja Along inside the FAAN territory”.
FAAN is located next to the Ikeja Along.
One unverified video posted to Twitter by user @Instablog9ja shows the damaged plane with one missing wing.
But another user @IWLTCTY suggested that the plane was being towed, writing: “There’s obviously a truck/trailer towing it.”
