In a Facebook post, Amadi admitted that Tinubu “is a great man” who has the right to run, describing him “perhaps the greatest politician in Nigeria today”.
“But I will not vote or support him. In my view, his profile is very questionable in many ways”, wrote Amadi who approved  120 percent of his total salary as severance package while he held swat at the commission..
“If he is president, it may look to some people as the equivalent of Nigeria being ruled by a one-man mafia, some would say, a criminal gang.
“This is a very corrupt country, almost a criminal state. Yes, we don’t need saints (we won’t even find them).
“But we don’t need someone whose important biodata are allegedly falsified or subject to controversy.
“We don’t need as President in 2023 someone who is stupendously wealthy; and we think his wealth may have been taken from the public (proven or not).”
Amadi’s profile equally has records of drawing large chunks of public wealth for himself and his commissioners when he was in office.
On August 15, 2014, the Daily Trust reported how the seven commissioners who constituted the board he chaired at their sixth management meeting passed a resolution which permitted them to receive 120 percent of their gross annual salary and two years’ salary in full amounting to N2.7 billion.
Proven or not, Amadi would collect N400 million and his men N300 million each.
