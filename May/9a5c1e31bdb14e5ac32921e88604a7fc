The investigative journalist, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, has reacted to the defection of Stella Oduah to the Peoples Democratic Party in Anambra State. In a recent interview on TVC News, Babajide shed more light on why Sella may have returned to the PDP a few months after she left the party to join the APC in Anambra State.
Discussing the topic, Babajide said, “She had defected to the APC for reasons best known to her. However, some people suggested that she might have defected so that she could be “left alone.” Sensing that the APC may not win in Anambra state, she returned to the PDP, which is stronger. She defected to the APC some months ago. We have to find a way to ban the idea of defecting from one party to another. It is too much.
He added, “Senator Ifeanyi Ubah of the YPP is strong, but zoning may not be in his favour, as people think that Nnewi and Aguata have had a fair share of the position.”
