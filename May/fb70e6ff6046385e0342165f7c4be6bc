The accident occurred around 5 am, and it involved a bus which rammed into a cement trailer parked along the Abuja/Kaduna road.
According to the state Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Hafiz Muhammad, fatigue might have contributed to the accident.
“The bus crashed into a BUA Cement trailer and then went into flames. Twenty-two people were inside the bus out of which 20 died,” he said.
“Those who died include 17 male adults, 2 women and a minor. They said the trailer was parked when the bus went under it. It was terrible because we always caution bus drivers against night journeys.”
