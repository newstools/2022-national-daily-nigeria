Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has admitted that he was surprised by Mbappe’s decision to snub Real Madrid to remain at PSG.
According to the Aston Villa manager should not always be the determinant factor when aiming at a football glory.
‘He is definitely thinking he is a little bit richer for sure,’ Gerrard told BT Sport.
‘But from a football decision, I do think in his quiet moment tonight if he has watched that game, he will think to himself, ‘I have just turned down the chance to join a club that has won 14 European Cups’, and they are going to be back because they recruit top players.
‘They have got the know-how, they have got the demand to win it, they are going to win more.
‘They have got the pull haven’t they, they have got the pull worldwide they are a giant in the game. They have got the pull where recruitment-wise, if a club like Real Madrid come along for you, 99 times out of 100 you go.’
