One of the governorship aspirants for the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, Revd. Fr. Hyacinth lormem Alia, may be losing his primary support base after he was suspended from public ministry by the Catholic Church, Gboko Diocese in Benue State.
The Catholic Church had in a statement by William Avenya, Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Gboko and Apostolic Administrator, See Vacante, revealed the suspension of Revd. Fr. Alia for delving into partisan politics, which was said to be against the rules of the mission.
The statement of the Catholic Bishop read: “May I begin by acknowledging and appreciating you for your commitment and dedication to the work of spreading the Good News of Christ.
“I wrote to communicate to you the suspension of my priest, Revd. Fr. Hyacinth lormem Alia from public ministry after series of admonitions to him Ex can. 1371, 2° CIC.
“The Mother Church does not allow her clerics to get involved in partisan politics on their own Ex can, 285, 3 CIC.
“You are aware that my son, your brother and your priest has purchased the party forms to contest for the Office of the Governor of Benue State under the All Progressives Congress (APC), which is totally against our vocation.
“Therefore, to respond to the spiritual and pastoral needs of the Church in the Catholic Diocese of Gboko, I have suspended him from the exercise of sacred ministry.”
The Catholic Bishop had said that the canonical suspension takes effect from the time it is transmitted to the priest and persists till he ceases from contumacy.
There have been insinuations that the APC leaders intended that Rev. Alia may have used his influence as a priest to pull the massive support of the church in the state for the party in the 2023 general elections. The suspension could separate the priest from his primary constituency.
