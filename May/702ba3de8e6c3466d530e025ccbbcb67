Leader of one of the terror groups terrorising Nigeria’s South-east has released a video declaring leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, Ralph Uwazurike, wanted for endorsing the presidential ambition of  Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello.
It would be recalled that Uwazuruike, last weekend led some South-East youths in a solidarity march in Owerri, Imo, in support of the 2023 presidential bid of Gov.  Yahaya Bello of Kogi.
Uwazuruike who also said he does not believe in the president of Igbo extraction said the contest should be thrown open.
However, in the video clip, seen by National Daily, the man warned Nwazurike to take his campaign to Kogi, insisting that no election will be held in Biafra land except a referendum is called in the region.

In the seven-minutes, twenty- seconds clip, the man said the open support by Nwazurike for Yahaya Bello’s presidential ambition, has now made him a target in their agitation for Biafraland.
“No more political posters in Biafraland. If you try us, you campaigning, fire will burn you. You think you can post any rubbish?
“We the unknown gunmen have endured enough from you. We shall no longer tolerate any rubbish from you,” he warned.
According to him, his group is different from IPOB, but that they shared similar objectives which is the liberation of Biafra land. “IPOB prefers peaceful protest on the streets, but we’re not following that road. Now, its fire for fire, so Nwazurike should take his support for Yahaya Bello to Kogi, and not in Biafra land.”
