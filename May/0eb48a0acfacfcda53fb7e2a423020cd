Richarlison scored a crucial second-half winner as Everton beat Chelsea to move within two points of the Premier League safety zone.
The Brazilian was gifted the chance as Cesar Azpilicueta dallied on the ball, allowing him to steal in and finish calmly.
Chelsea’s Mason Mount hit both posts with a 20-yard strike before Everton keeper Jordan Pickford brilliantly kept out Azpilicueta’s follow-up shot.
The win moves the Toffees to within two points of Burnley in 16th and Leeds in 17th, with a game in hand on both.
It started and ended with a flare and there were a few flare-ups in between as Everton gained the raw, visceral victory that gives them hope of surviving in the Premier League when it was beginning to feel like hope was gone.

For Frank Lampard, who meant so much to Chelsea over the past two decades, here was something of a belated gift, also, as Everton capitalised on a blunder by his former captain Cesar Azpilicueta while they were indebted to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford for two incredible saves.
Everton remain in the bottom three but have cut Leeds United and Burnley’s advantage over them back to just two points and they have a game in hand. With two of those fixtures at home it may be their form at Goodison Park, with the home fans playing such a huge part in this result that can help save them.
