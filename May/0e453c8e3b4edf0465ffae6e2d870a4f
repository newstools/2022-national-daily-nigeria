Justice Toyin Bolaji Adegoke of the Federal High Court sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, has convicted and sentenced 19-year old internet fraudster, Mgbak Okan Enyam to six months imprisonment for criminal impersonation.
Enyam was jailed on Monday, May 23, 2022, after pleading guilty to one-count charge preferred against him by the Uyo Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.
The one count charge read: “That you, Mgbak Okan Enyam (a.k.a Michelle A. Mccauley) “M” sometime in 2022 within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court did fraudulently impersonate one Michelle A. McCauley, a Crypto currency manager and Bitcoin Analyst, to unsuspecting victims, with intent to gain advantage for yourself and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 22 (2) (b) (i) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc ) Act 2015 and punishable under Section 22 (2) (2) (iv) of the same Act”.
He pleaded “guilty” to the charge when it was read to him.
In view of his plea, EFCC’s counsel, S. R. Akinrinlade, prayed the court to convict and sentence him accordingly.
Justice Adegoke convicted Enyam and sentenced him to six months imprisonment with an option of fine of N200, 000.00 (Two Hundred Thousand Naira). The court also ordered the convict to forfeit instruments used in committing the crime to the Federal Government.
Enyam’s journey to the Correctional Centre began when he was arrested by operatives of the Uyo Zonal Command of the EFCC, on March 31, 2022 in Calabar following verified intelligence concerning his involvement in cybercrimes. He was prosecuted and subsequently convicted.
