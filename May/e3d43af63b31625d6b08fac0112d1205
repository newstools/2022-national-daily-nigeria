Former President Goodluck Jonathan is condemning the APC and PDP primaries going on across the nation though he’s being mouthed I rumours and counter-rumours as the preferred candidate of the ruling APC who just ganted him a waiver on his defection from the PDP.
Delegates have confessed to making N400,000 each from some aspirants who were throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars around party secretariats across the nation.
Speaking on Thursday in Abuja at a book launch, Jonathan described the ongoing primaries as a mess.
“These whole primaries going on across the country is a mess. This is not a standard practice. The process has failed,” he said.
“We cannot use the process to elect president, governors, senators and House of Representatives members and others.
“The process has already failed, which is not good for the country. But we will manage and move on.”
But as one of the APC aspirants brought by the so-called Aso Rock cabal, he has to be a beneficiary of the process if he’s actually contesting to win the ticket as none of the aspirants is ready to step down for him.
