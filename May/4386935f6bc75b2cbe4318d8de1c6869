The investment banker stated that investors’ confidence in the Nigerian economy had declined, “The Nigerian economy was one of the fastest-growing until 2014. It grew steadily for 15 years but since 2015, it has been declining steadily. We need to ask ourselves what has changed.” he said.
Peterside clarified that, “This is not because other economies are also not growing. Others are growing but we are lagging. Investor confidence in the Nigerian economy is declining because there’s no level-playing field for the investors. The economy has been rigged to favour a few. To grow the economy, we have to create a level-playing field.”
According to the businessman, only the ICT and creatives sector are growing because the government is not involved, “This is because there is a level-playing field for all players in the two industries,” Peterside said.
