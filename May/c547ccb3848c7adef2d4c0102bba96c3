The teenager’s father, Ibrahim, a businessman, however, told the court that he was aware of the “extreme love” between his daughter and Yusuf, but added that Yusuf was yet to fulfill all known marriage rites.
After about a year he came back and took my daughter and ran away with her for three days. “We informed the police and both of were arrested and disciplined,” he said.
After their release from police custody, he said, they ran away again to Abuja where they spent two weeks.
Judge Murtala Nasir held that Yusuf’s father should be advised to allow the children get married.
“If he refuses, we will get them married in the court even without his blessings,” he said.
