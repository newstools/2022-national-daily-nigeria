Ukraine’s Armed Forces have eliminated the commander of a Russian air assault battalion of the 104th air assault regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Dosyagaev.
According to Ukrinform, the Department for Strategic Communications of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced this on Facebook.
“The commander of an air assault battalion of the 104th air assault regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Dosyagaev, became a VIP fan of Kobzon’s works. Alexander won the nomination ‘Winged Infantry’ at the festival ‘Russian Army 2021,’ but this did not help him at a meeting with Ukrainian warriors,” the statement said.
In early May, General David Petraeus, former CIA director and former commander of the United States Central Command, said that at least ten Russian generals had already been killed in Ukraine.
