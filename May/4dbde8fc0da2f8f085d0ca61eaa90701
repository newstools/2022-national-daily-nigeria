There is seeming uncertainty in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket. While in the public space, there is the assumption that the APC had zoned the presidency to the south considering the emergence of the national chairman from the north, APC national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, has said that the party has not yet zoned its presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections.
Senator Adamu, at the State House, Abuja, after presenting the APC candidate for the June governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari, said that the decision on zoning is the duty of the entire APC members, who, according to him, are bigger than him as national chairman.
