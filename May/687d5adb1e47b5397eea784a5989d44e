A Twitter user has come out with a different account of the Lekki jungle justice allegedly perpetrated by four Hausa Okada riders police might have arrested.
The Twitter user claimed to be a sister-in-law of David, the sound engineer who she said was killed by a mob which took him for a ritual killer.
In a series of Tweets, OpetheKing said that David was just out to separate a fight between two men and an Okada man in Lekki phase 1 when he was wrongly accused of being a Yahoo boy/ritualist.
According to her,  the two male passengers had given the Okada man N500 for a ride ofN400, and asked for their balance. However the okada rider told them he didn’t have N100 so they gave him N300 and promised to balance up whenever they are around the area stating that they regularly ply the road. The bike man refused to collect the said amount and this reportedly led to a fight.
The two men had the upper hand, beat the rider enough for him to black out.
On-lookers then drew closer and asked the men to wake the rider up or else…
Thre was an incidents in the area days before that when a man slumped and died, and residents blamed Yahoo boys on a bike for it.
The two passengers then called Daivid, a sound engineer.
According to her, when David saw the situation was getting intense, he went somewhere to hide. But a woman who was part of the crowd  who falsely accused David of being a Yahoo boy showed the mob where he was hiding.
She said the mob dragged David out, stripped him naked, beat him up until he died and then set his corpse on fire.
