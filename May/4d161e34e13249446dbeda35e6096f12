Okorocha, who is supposed to be facing trial for allegedly creaming off N2.9bn when he was Im governor, filed an ex parte application on Wednesday, saying his presidential ambition will suffer if he remains in EFCC’s detention where he was dragged.
But Justice Inyang Ekwo, before whom Okorocha has refused to appear, leading to his arrest, ruling on the bail application, said he was not inclined to admit him to bail.
Instead, the judge ordered Okorocha to put the federal government on notice to come and defend his detention.
