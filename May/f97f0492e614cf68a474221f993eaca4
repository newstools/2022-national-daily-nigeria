The Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), Hon. Rufus Bature, has said the rumored Governor Lalong’s preferred candidate for the 2023 governorship election, Dr. Nentawe Yilwada is a bonafide member of the Party.
Bature made the clarification on Sunday morning in Jos while addressing newsmen on the misinformation peddling on Social Media that Nentawe is not duly registered with the party.
The social media report which also indicted Bature to have said Nentawe is not an APC member also indicted Governor Lalong for imposing unregistered member on other aspirants.
Debunking the report, the APC Chairman said he cannot remember granting an interview to anyone on the status of Nentawe, nor has Governor Lalong endorsed any aspirant for the 2023 governorship election.
He said if Lalong has endorsed a candidate, by now no aspirant will still be campaigning for the primary election coming up next week.
“We have nine aspirants that obtained the APC governorship form and all of them are still in the race”, Bature said.
He continued: “Lalong has not endorsed any aspirant. As I speak, nine aspirants bought the expression of interest/nomination forms to contest the governorship primaries under our great party.
“There has been no such instruction of endorsing any aspirant from Mr. Governor and the Party, we are creating a level playing ground for all aspirants”, Bature said.
