The Senate on Tuesday reviewed the amended Electoral Act, making urgent amendment of section 84(4) of the Electoral Act to restore voting rights to statutory delegates of political parties who previously excluded from participating in state congresses and national conventions.
Statutory Delegates were identified to include President, present and former, Vice president, present and former; members of National Assembly, Governors, members of State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of local councils and National Working Committee (NWC) members of political parties.
The earlier amended Electoral Act mainly granted voting rights to elected delegates at party primaries.
