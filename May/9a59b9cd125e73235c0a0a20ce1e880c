The coalition expressed this in Abuja while addressing newsmen shortly after picking the APC Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for President for Adesina, who is currently the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB).
Asked if the coalition had reached out to Adesina and his response, Mr Ademola Babatunde, who led one of the coalition’s group, the Youth Arise Movement (YAM), said efforts were being made within and outside Nigeria to reach out to him.
Adesina was a former Nigeria’s Minister of Agriculture.
Babatunde, however, said no definite response had been received from Adesina on the appeal by the group on him to run for the 2023 presidential election.
“We have looked at the situation of this country, and our conclusion is that we need Dr Adesina to come and solve Nigeria’s problems and because of this, we have put our resources together.
“It is very certain that Adesina knows very well that when he was contesting for the AfDB, President Muhammadu Buhari supported him wholeheartedly for the first and second terms.
“Such a person will not want to throw away the call of over 200 million Nigerians and also feel that he cannot defend the legacy and the goodwill of the president of Nigeria.
“It is a time for him to come and reciprocate the good gesture that President Buhari has given to him by accepting this form that we have struggled to purchase.
“It is not easy to gather N100 million but we have ensured that we gather as many people as possible to raise the money,” Babatunde said.
Babatunde, who is a former presidential candidate of the defunct Nigeria Community Movement Party (NCMP) in the 2019 presidential election, said the form would be presented to Adesina as soon as possible, urging him to accept the the and contest.
“It is a gift to serve this country and solve our problems. We are calling Adesina because it’s a call to save Nigeria and I think he is going to accept,” Babatunde said.
He also expressed confidence that the coalition would meet up with the APC deadline for submission of the forms, saying we have people on ground and we are very certain that he is a member of APC before we begin to do what we are doing.
