Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, has revealed his stance on the nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress bought for his former boss, Goodluck Jonathan.
Some groups had on Monday purchased the APC Presidential form for the ex president. Jonathan has since denounced the move, stating he didn’t consent to the forms being bought for him.
In reaction to the news, social media users had wondered if Omokri, who has been a critic of the Buhari regime would defect to the APC with Jonathan.
He doused such thoughts in a tweet.
Omokri said, “First of all, to whet your appetite, let me say that under the rain and under the sun, I will follow Jonathan. Secondly secondly(sic), I can’t ever be one with APC. Thirdly, nobody can shave HE #GEJonathan’s head in his absence. Read between the lines. More to come!”
