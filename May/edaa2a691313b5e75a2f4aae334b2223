Aviation Associations comprising of an international coalition of aviation and medical professionals have protested that pilots and cabin crew suffer COVID-19 injuries in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland.
The Associations in a statement expressed “serious concerns about the compromise in aviation safety due to COVID-19 vaccine injuries among the flight crew.”
The statement indicated that scientists, advocacy groups, and doctors have been receiving reports of COVID-19 vaccine-injured airline pilots on a daily basis.
They empathized that the pilots suffer the following harms – blood clots, cardiovascular issues, auditory and neurological issues, and more.
The statement covered the interest of over 30 airlines, thousands of pilots, and over 17,000 physicians and medical scientists. The state was signed by Free to Fly from Canada, US Freedom Flyers, UK Medical Freedom Alliance, Airliners for Humanity from Switzerland, and others.
The associations in a statement on May 18, declared: “Many of our pilots have lost medical certification to fly and may not recover the same.
“Others are continuing to pilot aircraft while carrying symptoms that should be declared and investigated, creating human factors hazard of unprecedented breadth. The very foundation of our just safety culture—non-punitive reporting—no longer exists.
“Pilots have suffered and are suffering medical issues that at least correlate to receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. Their spectrum of symptoms is broad, ranging up to death. Pilots who report their injury face possible loss of licensing, income, and career while receiving little to no support from their unions, and a prosecutorial invective from employing airlines.”
