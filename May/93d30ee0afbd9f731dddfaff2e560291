With recent reports online that the Governor of the Central Bank Of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele has also paid the APC 100 million presidential nomination form days after the Minister Of State for Education did.
Psquare singer Rudeboy just reacted about this new development on his Instastory as he says, “Asuu is on strike people are still buying jamb form ABEG to go where? EDUCATION MINISTER DE BUY FORM CBN GOVERNOR DE BUY FORM LOOK AT THE ECONOMY ABEG WHO UNA WAN RULE?”
Check out the screenshots of his caption on Instagram below.
While it’s shocking to hear that the Governor of CBN can buy the presidential form while in office, Rudeboy’s statement shows that something is truly wrong somewhere and It’s true that a lot of things are on hold currently in the country.
And it seems that the Psquare brothers are also concerned about things being citizens of Nigeria as well after all his brother was reported to have complained about the large number of people with presidential ambitions.
