“There cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered, and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends,” he posted o Facebook and Twitter earlier.
But with a barrage of comments and threats from his northern followers supporting the mob action, Atiku quickly deleted the post Friday morning.

Writing on his Facebook page on Friday, Atiku said he did not give approval for the post.
He said, ”This evening I received information that a post was made that doesn’t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without AA is not from me. May God protect – AA.”
