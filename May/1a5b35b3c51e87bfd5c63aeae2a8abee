A popular professor of Journalism, Farooq Kperogi recently took to his Facebook page to react to the viral reports that other All Progressives Congress, APC, aspirants that vie for the governorship position in Lagos State with Babajide Sanwo-Olu were not allowed into the primary election premises, Farooq Kperogi said.
“Tinubu endorsed a disgraceful coronation of his handpicked stooge in the Lagos governorship primary “election” and shut out 2 other contestants who paid nomination fees. But he wants a fair contest for his presidential ambition in Abuja and chafes at a consensus. Karma is waiting for him in Abuja this weekend!”
There have been rumors that Buhari also has his own anointed presidential candidate. The truth is every governor, every President has anointed a successor. Obasanjo who didn’t know when and where the PDP was formed did. Buhari will anoint one, when he does that this week, those who will seek to challenge him will face what those who challenged Asiwaju for choosing Fashola faced.
Men have big egos. All the good governors, Peter Obi, Donald Duke, Ebeano, Saraki, Kwankwaso, and Shettima, all handed their party tickets to those they anointed. It’s the rule. Okay, call it the norm, here. Its true Jagaban owns the party and the party owes him a lot. But to tell Buhari not to anoint a successor is to reduce him to Fashola or Ikpeazu level. The man isn’t exactly a little godson riding and eating a lollipop on the back of his godfather.
He might not have won in 2015 all by himself, but he garnered the bulk of the votes himself. He is not Uduaghan. Those who will stand between him and the party ticket should be ready for a showdown. The Daura man is destined for his farm, and has nothing to lose. And he has 10 months to play with
