A leading presidential aspirant on the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, held a campaign inside a river in Ondo State on Tuesday, May 3, 2022.
Sowore had earlier declared his intention to run for president of Nigeria in 2023. The publisher of Sahara Reporters was the candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2019 presidential election.
Sowore was arrested by the Department of State Security (DSS) in August 2019 over his plan to organise an anti-government protest tagged “Revolution Now”. He was later granted bail by the court and his movement was restricted to Abuja.
Recently, a federal high court lifted the restriction placed on the presidential aspirant and cleared him of all allegations levelled against him.
In a caption shared on Tuesday, Sowore said he visited the Opotuo river in his hometown in Ondo state. According to him, the last time he was at the river was when he was nine years old.
Sowore was seen with residents of the community in the river in the pictures circulating on social media.
The pictures have generated a lot of reactions on social media. See some of the reactions below. Can Sowore emerge as the president of Nigeria?
