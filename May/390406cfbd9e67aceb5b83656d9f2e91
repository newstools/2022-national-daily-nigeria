In a photo posted by Sahara Reporters, Jonathan is seen shaking hands with Mamman Daura, the pillar of the Aso Rock cabal left after CoS Abba Kyari died in 2020.
The visit was the latest in the steps—confirming or denying—his interest I the 2023 presidency.
Before now, he distanced himself from the purchase of nomination forms by a group of Fulani ad almanjiri who are pressing him to contest.
The buying of form also came after Jonathan told his supporters to ‘watch out’.
It’s believed the first president from south-south desires to have the APC ticket –just for the asking.
Others aspirants, including APC leader Bola Tinubu, Gov. Kayode Fayemi, and V.P Yemi Osinbajo are not stepping down for anybody.
Since Jonathan’s rejected the generosity of the almanjiris who shelled out N100 million to buy the APC forms, nothing has changed.
The group submitted the form before the deadline, and the APC screen committee has said Jonathan is among those it will screen.
