All of the dead victims were northerners, and the killers were suspected to be IPOB.
The killing was among many of the cases that happened in the state on the weekend.
Anamabra has seen a lot of bloodshed lately, the most recent being  the decapitation of a state lawmaker Hon Okechukwu Okoye who was kidnapped seven days earlier.
According to the Daily Trust that broke the news, the state and the media have been silent about the incident.
The report further stated the Sarkin Hausawa of Orunba North LGA, Alhaji Sa’id Muhammad, said northerners in Anambra State have made up their minds to leave the state because of the constant killing of their relatives by members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the armed wing of the outlawed IPOB.
“The woman was from Adamawa State. Before her death, she lived in Orumba South, and on Sunday, she visited her friends with her four children,” Muhammad told the newspaper.
“It was on her way back home in Orumba South that she was killed. She was being conveyed by a commercial motorcyclist when they were ambushed by the gunmen. They murdered her and her four children but the motorcyclist escaped,” he said.
In a video trending on Twitter, the victims were seen lying in the pool of their blood with bullets spread around.
“Everybody should look at this video that they have shot a woman and her four children. They are from the North. And they are shooting everybody they see on the street; so people should be careful,” a narrator warned in Igbo.
No fewer than five commercial motorcycle riders were also killed and their bikes burnt at Onocha LGA. The bodies of four of the deceased were deposited in the morgue while the fifth one was burnt to ashes.
No official police statement yet.
