Ukraine has entered a fundamentally new phase – transferring the Armed Forces to NATO arms.


This was stated by Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba during a video feed on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
“We have entered a completely new phase, which even two months ago no one considered… We have entered a fundamentally new phase that no one even dreamed of – transferring the Armed Forces of Ukraine to NATO weapons, to the NATO standard. And this is already happening,” he said.
Kuleba noted that it all started with single steps and decisions, but President Volodymyr Zelensky was able to convince U.S. President Joseph Biden that it was time to make the move.
“Howitzers came in first, but this is just the beginning. Much more will come. And this is a historic moment, this is a historic turning point,” the head of Ukrainian diplomacy stressed.
As Ukrinform reported earlier, on April 19, the Pentagon announced the holding of exercises for the Ukrainian military on the use of American howitzers, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday.
