A day after V.P Yemi Osinbajo met with and got support of the governor of Gombe in the coming presidential primary, APC leader Bola Tinubu also visited to garner sympathies for his ambition.
“Today is the day I have come to ask for your support to be president of Nigeria. You can put me there with your voters.
“I believe in myself, I’m confident, capable, intelligent, courageous, brave, determined, and the government is not a joke. In the coming delegate election,” Tinubu said on Tuesday.
“We have an opportunity to change Nigeria, I guarantee we will change Nigeria. The change in Lagos is just beginning, the change that made Lagos the richest state in Africa now. We will collaborate with all the states of the federation,” he added.
And Tinubu got Gov. Yahaya Inuwa’s chief of staff and some.
Inuwa Kari said it is payback time because Tinubu has worked assiduously for the growth of the APC.
“We know what we did to put the party together. Through this great man, we are at the Villa, and we are in charge of the government in Gombe,” Kari said.
Kari, who doubles as state coordinator of Asiwaju movement 2023 in Gombe, urged people to rally round the national leader towards realising his aspiration.
Gov Inuwa gave similar assurance to Osinbajo.
“Today is yet another remarkable occasion, because on many occasions, the Vice President has been coming to the state as Vice President; but this time around, he has come to interact with our delegates, preparatory to the primaries of our ruling party, the APC, and it is a convention that will produce him, by the Grace of God, as the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said on Tuesday.
