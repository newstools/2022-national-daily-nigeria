The Big Brother Naija star boasted that her entire look costs over $100,000 and warned critics to stay off.
She said, “My entire look is worth over 100k USD. Yes, you read that right. If you don’t have a minimum of 10k USD in your domiciliary account, you have no right to speak on my look.”
Ifu Ennada also hailed her designer, Toyin Lawani.
She pointed out that her mission at the #AMVCA wasn’t to win the ‘Best Dressed’ award but to “bring Met Gala to AMVCA and I did just that.”
