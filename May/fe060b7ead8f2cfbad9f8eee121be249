The Police Public Relationship Officer (PPRO), Michael Abattam, disclosed this in a statement.
According to the release, “ESN members in their numbers emerged from the surrounding bushes, shooting sporadically at the policemen while conducting stop and search duty.
“The officers who swiftly took cover and responded, engaged them in a fierce gun duel, while they called for backup from the Divisional Police Headquarters, Agwa .
“On arrival, they positioned themselves strategically and professionally engaged the hoodlums in a fire fight.
“For the operatives’ superior firepower and number, they were able to neutralize two of the hoodlums while others fled in disarray with bullet wounds into the bush.
“The police operatives tactically chased the hoodlums, in the process, combing the bush for possible recovery of their arms and arrest of the fleeing suspects. However, two locally made double barrel guns with seven live cartridges and ten expended cartridges were recovered at the scene.”
During the attack, one of the police officers paid the supreme price while others were treated and discharged from the hospital for minor injuries they sustained.
The police spokesman while narrating the incident, said corpses of the hoodlums were later deposited in Federal Medical Center Mortuary while investigation is ongoing.
