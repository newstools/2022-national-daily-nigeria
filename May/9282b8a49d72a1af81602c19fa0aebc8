The Nigerian legendary singer, 2face Idibia has come under heavy criticism for celebrating Grammy-award-winning singer Burna Boy following his latest achievement during the ‘One Night In Space’ concert.
We recall that Burna Boy grabbed people’s attention online with his performance during the ‘One Night In Space’ concert at the Madison Square Garden, which took place on Thursday, April 28, 2022, in New York.
Burna Boy wowed his fans with his performance, and a video shared by Goldmyne TV captured some female fans throwing their bras at the singer, not minding that it was underwear.
During his performance, Burna Boy, at some point, stopped to pick the bras while encouraging the female fans to throw more of their bras at him.
Taking to his Instagram page, 2face hailed Burna Boy for the remarkable achievement stating that young Nigerian men and women are doing massive things worldwide.
He wrote: Like a Movie!!! It was all a dream. Mad Young Naija men/women doing massive things all over the world. #WARRIORS Big up @burnaboygram.
The post earned 2face Idibia backslashes as many netizens criticized him for not celebrating Davido after his concert at the 02 Arena.
