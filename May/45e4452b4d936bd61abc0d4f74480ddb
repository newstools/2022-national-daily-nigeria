This becomes necessary as the primary race in the party may get crowded soon.
V.P Yemi Osinbajo is reaching out, too, to a candidate in the north.
Before now, the party informally agreed to zoning of the ticket to the south, and only one aspirant, party leader Bola Tinubu, was out consulting. Although Kogi Gov Yahaya Bello, north central, was asking the party to discard zoning as he consulted too.
But sources are revealing how intrigues may eventually make the APC let the contest open for all after Sen Rochas Okorocha, Osinbajo, Ministers Rotimi Amaechi and Chris Ngige declared intentions, too.
Bello now stands alone as the first and only candidate from the north.
The Osinbajo camp is, however, working to snag whatever opportunity the loner from the north presents.
The Nation reported the VP camp has reached out to Yahaya’s group—for collaboration.
“Bello’s group is not yet keen on such a partnership,” the newspaper quoted a source privy to the discussion.
