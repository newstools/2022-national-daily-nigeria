A governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Farrah Dagogo, on Wednesday failed to halt the primary election of the party in Rivers State.
The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja dismissed an experte application brought before it by Farrah Dagogo seeking to stop the PDP primaries in Rivers from holding on Wednesday, May 25.
The court dismissed Dagogo’s suit for being filed out of time, noting that the applicant could not demand urgency in the court.
The Presiding Judge, Justice Taiwo, had earlier ordered the PDP and INEC, to appear in court and show cause why the injunctive order filed by Dagogo should not be granted against them.
At the resumption of proceedings on Wednesday, counsel to Dagogo, stated before the court that the PDP did not follow the right procedure, saying that his client complied with all the requirements of the party guidelines, before being deprived of screening, thereby, violating the guidelines of party primaries regulation. He argued that his client’s rights were violated in the whole process.
Counsel to the PDP, citing section 25(1) of the 1999 constitution as amended and section 84(14) of the Electoral act 2022, argued that Dagogo cannot impose Jurisdiction on the court.
The PDP counsel appealed to the court to dismiss the suit, saying that the urgency of the matter is self-induced.
Farrah Dagogo had approached the court, seeking an order restraining the PDP and INEC from conducting the PDP primary scheduled for May 26, 2022, in Rivers State.
The court adjourned hearing on the substantive suit to June 7.
