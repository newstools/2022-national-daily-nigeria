No fewer than 40 cows also died in the burn truck at Uga, Aguata local government area.
Attackers, numbering over 10, were reportedly shouting “this is Biafra land and not Fulani”.
But chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria MACBAN, Alhaji Gidado Sidikki, said the cows do not belong to his members, but to some Igbo businessmen.
Anambra police spokesman Ikenga Tochukwu confirmed the incident, though he said the cows were rescued by security operatives who responded swiftly.
He also said the persons in the truck, including the driver, were rescued unhurt, adding that only the front of the truck got burnt and not the entire body.
