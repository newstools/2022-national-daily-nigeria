Bala will be contesting with ex-SSG Ibrahim Kashim  who clinched the ticket of the party in the primary conducted last week.
The Returning Officer for the election, Hassan Ahmed Grema, had declared Kashim, the sole aspirant, as winner, saying he polled a total of 655 votes out of the 656votes, while one was invalid.
Shortly after the declaration, Kashim said he had accepted the mandate given to him by the delegates.
“The contest has just begun for 2023. The PDP is ready to beat every other opposition,” he had said.
But after Bala, a first-term governor, polled 20 at the presidential primary, Kashim allegedly withdrew his candidature and submitted his candidature.
“Since he stepped down on his own the party is left with no option but to get his replacement through fresh Primary election,” the party publicity secretary, Yayanuwa Zainabari, said.
Kashim himself has yet to make any offcial statemet on that, though.
Sokoto Gov Aminu Tambuwal, a first-term governor then,  took a similar track when he lost to V.P Atikeu Abubakar in 2019.
