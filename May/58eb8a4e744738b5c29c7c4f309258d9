President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision that all heads of agencies, departments, parastatals, and ambassadors with political ambitions resign their posts has sparked outrage.
According to Anaedoonline.ng, the President announced this in a circular signed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, on Thursday.
‘Ministers, heads of government agencies, ambassadors, and other appointments with political ambitions should leave,’ said the circular, which had the reference number SGF/OP/ I/S.3/XII/ 173.
The President also ordered Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to retire in a circular sent on Thursday.
Mustapha indicated that agency heads and other officials must quit no later than Monday, May 16.
However, some Nigerians have taken to social media to react to the reports that the CBN Governor and other appointees have been asked to vacate their offices.
