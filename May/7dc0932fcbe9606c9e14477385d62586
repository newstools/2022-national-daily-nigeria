Valeria and Andrew were married May 5, and Andrew was killed May 8,  according to a Facebook post by Valeria on Wednesday.
The post included photographs of the two getting married in a bunker wearing their uniforms and photographs of the couple before the siege began.
The Facebook post — created on Wednesday night local time — also includes a message from Valeria:
“You were my legal husband for three days.
And for eternity you are my love.
My dear, my caring husband.
You were and are the best.
All I have left is your last name, your loving family and memories of a happy time together.”
She promised him that she would survive the siege – and live for the two of them.
