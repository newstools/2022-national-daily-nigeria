Thibaut Courtois’ plaque has been removed from the Wanda Metropolitano after his MOTM performance for Real Madrid in the UCL final, per Marca.
Atlético president Enrique Cerezo said earlier Monday, “If you want to remove Courtois’ plaque, go with an axe and shovel and remove it.”
Thibaut Courtois’ plaque at the Wanda Metropolitano for his 154 official appearances for Atlético de Madrid between 2011 and 2014 was removed from the club’s Walk of Legends on Monday. The Belgian goalkeeper’s words before the Champions League final (“Now I’m on the good side of history”) did not go down well with Atletico Madrid fans, who showed their displeasure with their former player in a very forceful manner.
Courtois’ reaction was swift. Social networks offer the possibility of sending messages instantly and so did the Real Madrid goalkeeper. First, the player posted a photograph of himself with the Champions League trophies and MVP of the final against Liverpool. He accompanied the snapshot with a meaningful “Hala Madrid”.
The goalkeeper then ‘liked’ the following tweet: “While Atleti fans rip off his plaque, Thibaut wins a Champions League and MVP of the final. He must be worried sick. With these two gestures, Courtois made it very clear that nothing is going to spoil the special moment he is living after lifting his first Champions League title.
