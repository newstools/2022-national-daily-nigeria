The police said that the man whose face is captured in the viral video is strongly suspected to be a foreigner from the neighbouring Niger Republic, according to a report by Peoples Gazette.
According to the Police, the suspect could not yet be found in the Sokoto metropolis.
“We started looking for him immediately we saw his video on social media, because he is fundamental to our investigation.
“We are now learning that he is not even a Nigerian but only came in illegally from Niger Republic to cause chaos in our country,” a top police source told the publication.
According to the police source, Interpol might be deployed to help fish out and arrest the suspect.
Again, other police sources believe the suspect is a Nigerian and is still within the country’s borders.
Leaders of Islam in Nigeria, including the Sultan of Sokoto, have condemned the killing as unIslamic, calling for justice.
