The senator representing Anambra North senatorial zone, Senator Stella Uduah has stirred reactions from fans and followers after sharing the photo she took while observing her compulsory National Youth Service Corps in 1982 at Lagos state.
The former minister of Aviation shared the photo on her verified Facebook Page as a proof to confirm that she completed her NYSC program in Lagos State.
The Senator was accused in a letter dated 24th of May 2022 by the National Youth Service Corps that she was mobilised to the NYSC camp in Lagos state but later absconded and was not issued a discharge certificate when she completed the programme. But she has now refuted the claim by sharing a letter from her Place of Primary Assignment including her picture.
Fans took to the comment box of the photo and reacted as follows: many were of the opening that the senator looked very beautiful even at a young age.
