A woman pronounced dead after a car crash shocked mourners at her funeral when she began banging on the coffin.
Rosa Isabel Cespedes Callaca had been announced dead in a fatal accident that also claimed the life of her brother-in-law, reported the Daily Star.
Her three nephews were left with serious injuries following the incident which took place on the region’s Chiclayo road.
Funeral for Rosa Isabel Cespedes Callaca was underway when family members heard a noise from her coffin at the service in the city of Lambayque in Peru last week.
Mourners were in shock when they heard noises at the start of the service.

Her relatives, who had lifted the coffin onto their shoulders, immediately lowered it and opened the lid to find her alive and peering at them.
Cemetery caretaker Juan Segundo Cajo commented: “[She] opened her eyes and was sweating. I immediately went to my office and called the police.”
Her family picked up the coffin and took it to the Referential Hospital Ferrenafe in Lambayeque, with Rosa still inside, reports the Metro.
Concerned medics put Rosa on life-support after they noticed she had weak signs of life but she sadly died a few hours later.
Her family are calling on healthcare bosses for answers to find out why she was declared dead “in the first place”.
Her aunt told local media: “We want to know why my niece reacted when we were taking her to be buried. We have videos in which she pushes and touches the coffin.”
Rosa’s relatives believe she may have been in a coma after the accident which could be the reason medics thought she was dead.
Police in Peru are now investigating the incident, which took place at the Lambayeque Regional Hospital where she first received treatment.
