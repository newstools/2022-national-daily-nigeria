Ali Makoda becomes the latest associate of Gov Umar Ganduje defecting to the new party whose national leader is former Gov. Rabiu Kwakwanso.
The next might be Senator Ibrahim Shekarau.
Shekarau has not been pacified though Ganduje visited him Friday night to prevent his defection to the NNPP.
The former senator lost a legal battle of supremacy at the Supreme Court Thursday
A private jet was sent to Kano to bring Ganduje and Shekarau to Abuja for reconciliation. It was purported to be a directive from President Muhammadu Buhari—only for Shekarau to find out the APC national chairman Abdullahi Adamu was behind it.
The Daily Trust reported the former governor had to turn back on his way to the airport.
At least six APC heavyweights in the state have dumped the party so far.
