Mr Deji Adeyanju, a political activist from Kogi state, has reacted to the viral video of the governor of Kogi state’s wife, Her Excellency, Mrs Rashida Yahaya Bello, giving large sums of money to her security

Mrs Bello first said to her security men present in the video, which Mr Deji uploaded on his verified Facebook Page, that by the grace of God, each person will receive one million naira.
While the first lady began handing out the wands of cash to the security personnel and others in the room, they became ecstatic. Mr Deji Adeyanju, who is well-known for his humanitarian endeavors, was not impressed by what the first lady did in that video.
Mr Deji, who has been a vocal critic of Governor Yahaya Bello’s administration, responded to the footage by saying, “Kogi is bleeding” through a post he made on his Facebook page.
