Nigerian veteran singer, Charly Boy, has taken to social media to air his opinion, following the request for the breakup of Nigeria by the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto diocese, Most Reverend Mathew Hassan Kukah.
Recall that Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah had earlier on, stated that he has never been unsure of the future of Nigeria as he is currently, adding that when other countries of the world were busy developing themselves after gaining their freedoms, Nigerians decided to fast and pray against the devil.
The clergyman further revealed that God finally answered the prayers of Nigerians and that is why the number of churches cannot be compared to the number of schools and hospitals in the country.
Bishop Kukah finally stated that it is time for the country to end so that those that want development can go ahead with it.
However, following Bishop Kukah’s statement, Nigerian legendary singer, Charly Boy, took to his official Instagram page to react, as he asked his fans and followers on social media platforms if they agree with Bishop Kukah’s call for the disbandment of Nigeria.
