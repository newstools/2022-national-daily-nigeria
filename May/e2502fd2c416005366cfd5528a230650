Acting National Chairman of the SDP,  Supo Shonibare, stated this in a chat with newsmen on during the party’s congress in Lagos.
There have been speculations that Tinubu, among other aspirants likely to feel cheated, may dump their parties for an alternative.
And the SDP is being strongly considered as an alternative.
The acting National Chairman however explained that while the party welcomes any politician from other parties, those to be admitted must be people of integrity without any baggage.
“We welcome people from other political parties who feel that they have been unjustly treated in their present party, but we will not be a vehicle for opportunistic individuals who in our own judgement think have been part of the problem of Nigeria.
“SDP cannot be a clone of PDP or APC, in that case why are we offering ourselves as alternatives.
The chairman admitted that there are aspirants with high integrity in APC and PDP and they are the ones the party will welcome.
“If, prima facie, we look at their matter and we see that there are allegations against them that are waiting, because we have a committee consisting of lawyers, if they look at the allegations, particularly when the charge has been proffered, and the person has not been convicted, we will not wish to push people like that as our flag bearers in the face of indictment.”
