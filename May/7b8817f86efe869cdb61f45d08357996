Following the flight glitch observed yesterday, Dana Airline has apologized to passengers over TAKE-OFF hiccups of aircraft with registration number 5N JOY operating flight 9J 344 from Port Harcourt to Lagos on Monday May 2,  2022.
It was confirmed that one of the airline’s aircraft caught fire during take-off from Port Harcourt airport.
Also in February, a fully loaded Lagos-bound Dana Flight made an emergency landing in Abuja due to a technical fault that wasn’t made known to the public, making it the second in two months.
The Airline in a statement issued on Tuesday said the affected aircraft was set to take off when the pilot in command noticed an anomaly which he queried with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) before embarking on a ramp return in line with our strict safety operating procedures.
The statement read: However, the impact on the brakes as a result of the aborted take-off affected the aircraft tyres which sparked off while the aircraft was taxiing to re-park.

All 50 passengers onboard the aircraft disembarked safely and our maintenance team immediately grounded the aircraft pending the conclusion of their investigations.
“Once again, we sincerely apologize to all the passengers on the flight for the inconveniences caused due to the eventual cancellation of the flight.
“At Dana Air, the safety of our passengers and crew will remain a top priority in all aspects of our operations and we will continue to operate in accordance with the civil aviation regulations and global best practices.
