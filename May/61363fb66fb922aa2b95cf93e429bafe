Peter, who pleaded guilty and was accordingly convicted, also begged the court to tamper justice with mercy as he was a single father of three children.
The convict, in addition, stated that having lost his job and the need to cater for his children, made him commit the crime.
Magistrate Mariam Sa’id sentenced Peter, who resides at Navy Estate, Karshi, Abuja, on a count charge of theft, without an option of fine.
She said the judgment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in any criminal act.
Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Okokon Udo, told the court that the convict committed the crime on April 29.
Udo further averred that Peter, on the mentioned date, used a master key to open about five cars parked at the premises of National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), Abuja.
The prosecutor also said Peter, after opening the cars, proceeded to steal the laptops from the cars and was captured on a CCTV camera while committing the act.
The offence, according to Udo, contravened the provisions of Section 287 of the Penal Code Law.
