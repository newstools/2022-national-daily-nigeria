You can benefit from some things from unripe plantains when you eat them regularly because they contain some powerful antioxidants and fiber, which help to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood and also eliminate free radicals that can cause harm or damage to the tissues and organs in the body.

Unripe plantains offer a wide range of healthy benefits when consumed on a regular basis, but not many people like to eat them because they’re not as sweet as ripe plantains. However, in this article, I want to briefly discuss three things that eating unripe plantains can do for you.
1. Unripe plantains, when consumed regularly, can help the body to regulate or control the amount of cholesterol in the blood because they contain a decent amount of fibre. The high fibre content of plantain also helps in controlling stool by making it soft for easy passage out of the body.
2. It also contains important nutrients that help in the easy break down of food particles into smaller units during digestion. The antioxidant properties of plantain make it a good neutralizer of free radicals as it helps in removing them from the body, thereby protecting the various parts of the body from being damaged by free radicals.
3. Plantain is very rich in healthy carbs and good fibre that work together to remove excess fat from the body. Eating plantains on a daily basis keeps your stomach full due to its high fibre content, and by burning fat in the body, it keeps the body fit and healthy.
