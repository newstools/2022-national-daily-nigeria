Prophet Godfrey Gbujie of te World Zionist Union, before the primary election predicted that former Anambra governor, Peter Obi, will emerge as the party’s flagbearer instead of Atiku.
He noted that the duo of Atiku Abubakar and governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike “are not favoured by God for the position”.
“I started praying for divine intervention due to concerns being felt about the primaries.
“I was even interceding for Gov. Wike until about 1:40 a.m. this morning when I got a revelation that there has been a plan to use money to change the delegates list in favour of someone else.
The southeast prophet said moneybags would not have their ways.
But Obi defected from the PDP days ago because, many believed, the process was heavily monetized, and Obi is synonymous with frugality.
His fate in the Labour Party he joined is not certain.
