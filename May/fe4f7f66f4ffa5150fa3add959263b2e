The lady who made a viral TikTok video claiming she slept with a dog for N1.7 million has said she was merely “catching cruise,” a slang word for joking.
The slim, light-skinned woman with TikTok user ID @Veegodess has been trending on social media after saying there was no big deal about bestiality.
She claimed in the video that contrary to what people think about sleeping with a dog, she had never contracted any disease.
“What is the big deal there? I only slept with a dog, I didn’t kill somebody. You, in your life, you have done worse and besides, have you seen N1.7million before?
“As if it’s a big deal. And mind you I’m not infected or anything. Stop dying on the matter, I’m enjoying the money,” she stated in the first video.
But following backlash from Nigerians who condemned her for the act, the lady recanted, apologizing to her fans and Nigerians for the costly joke.
