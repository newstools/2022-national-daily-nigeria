An Italy-based drug trafficker, Nwakanma Uche, has excreted 95 pellets of heroin after he was arrested by operatives of the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
Uche was arrested at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, after the agency discovered that he had ingested the pellets.
The NDLEA Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, who disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said the suspect was arrested while trying to board an Air France plane on his way to Paris, France, and Milan, Italy, on May 15.
Babafemi said: “He was thereafter kept under observation, during which he excreted the 95 pellets of the illicit drug. He claimed he came to see his parents in Nigeria after 12 years in Italy.

“The suspect, Henry Okamaru (a.k.a. Lawrence Ik Okamaru), was arrested in Ondo State after five months of a manhunt by NDLEA operatives. Two suspects – Matthew Donuwe and Friday Nmborgwu – were arrested in connection with the consignment in December 2021.”
