Adeyanju Deji took to his Facebook page to write an open letter to Olubankole Wellington, aka Banky W, after he was allegedly unable to clinch the House of Representatives ticket of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos state.

In the letter, he advised Olubankole Wellington to resign from the PDP and go to the NNPP, the Labour Party, or the SDP. He stated that the PDP is a dollar party and they cannot change from their old ways of selling their tickets to the highest bidder because all they care about is money.
Deji Adeyaju stated that the PDP is cursed and all they care about is dollars, as he alleged that Banky W didn’t get the ticket according to the latest scheme perpetrated by the party, even though there were rumors some days ago that he had won the primary elections.
According to a report Deji Adeyanju posted, Banky W and a man named Mr. Aiboni Sam contested for the ticket, and the latter won the ticket. See the report below.
