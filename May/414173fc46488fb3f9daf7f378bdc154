Deji Adeyanju had reacted to the report by a former Buhari’s PA, Bashir Ahmad who is vying for the post of the National House of Representatives that thugs have taken over the primary election venue. Deji Adeyanju said,
“Bashir spent the last 7yrs justifying every rigging and electoral malpractice of APC but just collected breakfast in APC Kano. Today, he has become a victim.”
There is a lot of aspect in our political history that needs reform by the policymakers. How can thugs hijack a primary election where the people that will represent them at the various political posts? That is an element of rigging that Nigeria should have stopped by now.
If we don’t kill election rigging, we can’t get the best candidates to represent us at the various political offices in Nigeria. It looks like Bashir Ahmad has been cheated or has seen that the primary election is not favorable to him.
