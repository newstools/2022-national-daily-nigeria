Unknown gunmen ravaging Anambra State on Monday stormed a police checkpoint in Ogidi, Idemili North Local Government Area, Anambra State, killing one police officer while escaping with a police rifle collected from the dead officer.
The gunmen were said to have ambushed the police personnel at a regular check point near Ogidi Town Hall. They had descended on the police unawares in the attack.
The Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, acknowledging that there was exchange of gunfire between police officers and some hoodlums, could not confirm the death of any police personnel, but admitted that one of the police officers suffered fatal injury.
Ikenga while affirming one police officer suffered fatal injury, said that the superior fireworks of the police compelled the gunmen to flee.
The PPRO said that the police have intensified patrol of the environment.
