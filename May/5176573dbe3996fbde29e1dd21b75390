The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has denied declaring for the 2023 presidential race. He said that he will make the decision whether to contest the 2023 presidential election in few days’ time. A political group which had been campaigning for him across the country, especially in the north, had earlier in the week, bought the N100 million expression of interest and nomination form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the CBN governor.
Emefiele in a series of tweets on his official handle on Saturday, expressed gratitude to the supporters who contributed money to purchase the N100 million APC presidential forms for him, saying that he is humbled by the massive support. He, however, stated that he has not come to the decision to contest for president.
The CBN governor had written on his twitter handle: “I am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the Office of President in the 2023 general elections: I have not come to that decision. I note and salute the sacrifices of those farmers and patriots going as far as raising personal funds and offering me Presidential Nomination Forms: I thank them most profusely.
“However, should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my own Nomination Forms without proxies in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria.
“And should I not run for elected office, I will continue to serve and sacrifice for the good people of Nigeria under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is a serious decision that requires God’s divine intervention: in the next few days The Almighty will so direct.”
