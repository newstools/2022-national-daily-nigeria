Lawan bought the N100 million forms last week, joining close to 30 others in on the race.
Kalu was the first to step down for Lawan, citing the failure of the APC to zone the ticket to the southeast.
“Lawan’s candidature will rock like a hurricane. The issue of the APC presidential candidate will be settled even before the primaries. As I am talking to you, about nine presidential aspirants from our party have intimated me of their plans to drop their presidential ambition to support Ahmad Lawan,” he told the Daily Trust.
“I have repeated my reasons for dropping my ambition for Lawan many times and I am sure Nigerians are aware already. We are also expecting an influential presidential aspirant from the opposition to join the APC.
“So, you can see the party is very progressive and properly ready for Lawan’s emergence.”
On the call for the postponement of primary by some political parties, Kalu said he did not expect the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to listen to them.
He said the parties were duly informed and should have prepared well as mandated by the electoral body.
“Extension of the dates will only support irresponsibility. Nigerians find it difficult to keep to time and appointments and that is why they would always seek extra time.”
“I support INEC to stick to their timetable, otherwise we will be living with postponement after postponement. Such a trend is not healthy for a society and its people.
“We complain of indiscipline but not ready to be practical about the requirements of discipline. INEC should discipline any party that fails to meet up, because that is the only way they can take their jobs seriously,” Kalu said.
