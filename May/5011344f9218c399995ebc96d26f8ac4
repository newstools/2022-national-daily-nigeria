Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced this while briefing State House reporters on the outcome of the federal cabinet meeting presided over by Buhari at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja.
He said the ministers have been given up till May 16, 2023, to quit the cabinet.
Among the ministers eyeing elective seats are Rotimi Amaechi (Transportation), Chris Ngige (Labour), Abubakar Malami (Justice), Godswill Akpabio (Niger Delta).
The instruction came after an appeal court set aside an earlier ruling which the government appointees were relying on to dig in their heels in government while they seek support to become president and governor.
