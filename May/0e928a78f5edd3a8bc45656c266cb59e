The World Health Organisation has been accused of colluding with pharmaceutical conglomerates, non-state parties, the deep state and other non-state actors for the imposition and administration of hardly tested mixtures as vaccines as well mandating masks.
The WHO was also accused of turning itself into a global agent of powerful western capitalists whose only interest in the fight against Covid-19, was money and hegemonic domination and control of developing and third world nations.
Unfortunately, the WHO has not done anything to discourage this thinking. Rather, evidence keeps emerging of the global organization positioning itself into a world power with a huge authority over what happens within the sovereign territory of nations.
As the world is recovering from the disruptions and hardships caused by the WHO dictated measures implemented by different countries, the United States Permanent Mission to the WHO submitted to the WHO a strange proposal to amend several Articles of the IHR. Ordinarily, going by the title and introduction to the text of the proposal, one would be forgiven if it is assumed that the proposal is intended for the greater good of all and to genuinely prepare the world for future outbreaks of global infections.

However, reading in between the lines of the texts being smuggled into the IHR and the ones proposed to be deleted from the existing law, one would clearly see the inevitably transmutation of the WHO into a totalitarian body with authority to walk across international borders without regard to rules of national sovereignty on the pretext of fighting outbreak of infection of global concern.
The WHO, as the global primary policy maker and stakeholder in public health is the implementer of the IHR. Without any doubt, in the about 15 years of the promulgation of the IHR, at no time has the use and abuse of the legal instrument been tested as was seen since 2020/2021 during the outbreak and aftermath of the Covid-19.
Equally important is the fact that authority to make rules, regulations and policies for a people or nation must flow from the persons appointed or elected by the people themselves, which is not the case with global organization and multinational bodies whose leadership is controlled by powerful organizations and governments who provide the bulk of the operating resources of the bodies.
A careful study and review of the texts being removed from the law and the ones being introduced to the IHR clearly, very clearly show that these amendments have nothing to offer by way of ‘STRENGHTENING WHO PREPAREDNESS FOR AND RESPONSE TO HEALTH EMERGENCIES’ but a clandestine script for the positioning of the WHO as a world government and legalizing the transfer of national sovereignty of nations to the WHO and a fortiori, those persons and organizations who sponsor and control it.

The amendment being made to the original text of this article, proposes to remove the requirement for the WHO to consult and obtain verification by nation where it is alleged that a public health emergency of international concern has occurred before moving in or taking measures within or outside the country with respect to the alleged occurrence.
This no doubt would be used by powerful nations and indeed, organizations to impose medicines, vaccines and measures on the citizens of nations that the people or their elected leaders are opposed to.
In the text proposed to be inserted into this section, it is made a matter of compulsion of a sort for a country to accept within 48 hours, an offer for collaboration and also provide requested information by the WHO on an allegation that a health emergency of international concern has
Under the proposed amendment being introduced here, the Director General of the WHO would become a global emperor with powers to declare a health emergency has occurred within a state party even when the national authority of the country has not made such determination or does not accept the report of the WHO on the occurrence, including allegations of potential occurrence.
