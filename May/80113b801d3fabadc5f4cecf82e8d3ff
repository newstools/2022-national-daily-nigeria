With respect to the INEC’s deadline for party primaries, it is no longer news that the two main political parties in the country are set to conduct their primaries in the last days of May.
Famous human rights activist and socio-political commentator, Deji Adeyanju has revealed why he wants APC to win the 2023 elections.
In a post on his verified Facebook handle, the convener of the Concerned Nigerians advocacy group said:
‘I hope that APC will win the 2023 elections convincingly so that PDP will learn a bitter lesson that impunity does not pay. The party as presently constituted today is undemocratic and extremely corrupt.’
The advocate of Igbo presidency remarked that the People’s Democratic Party are practically selling their slots to the highest bidders. He laments:
‘PDP cannot change. At least in APC, they call all parties to the table and try to work out a consensus. These PDP NWC are just selling tickets to people that bring money.’

What are your thoughts on Deji Adeyanju’s submission?
