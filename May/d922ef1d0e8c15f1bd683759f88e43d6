We can’t continue to deny the fact that deaths caused by diabetes are becoming more prevalent in our society. It’s saddening to see that more people are dying because of a lack of basic knowledge on how to effectively manage their diabetic condition.
Experts have discovered that people living with diabetes can live longer and grow old if they make some lifestyle which I’ll be talking about in this article according to WebMD. Please read to the end and share with others, it might save a life.
1. Your diet mattersIt is very important to know that your eating habit has to change immediately after you’re diagnosed with diabetes because what you eat affects your blood sugar. You have to focus more on eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, non-fat dairy and lean meats. Foods high in sugar and fat will only make your condition worse, so limit them
2. Exercise is crucialYou must exercise regularly as a diabetes patient, this will help burn off excess calories, and sugar and ease stress. If you haven’t been exercising before, start slowly and then increase your tempo gradually. Your goal should be 30 minutes of exercise every day. You don’t have to join a gym, walking, biking or even playing video games can do the trick
3. Regular checkups are keyMany people avoid the hospital after their diabetes diagnosis, this is wrong. Don’t run away from people who will help you. You need to see your doctor at least twice a year and any other time you observe strange symptoms in your body.
Please note that;
A. You need to always check for cholesterol, blood pressure and A1c (average blood sugar over 3months).
B. You should also go for full eye exams every year
C. It is important to visit a foot doctor to check for problems like foot ulcers and nerve damage.
