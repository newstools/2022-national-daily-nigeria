An investigative journalist, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, has shed more light on the recent activities of Boko Haram terrorists in the northeastern part of the country. In a recent interview on TVC News, Babajide revealed that he recently returned from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, in a recent interview.
Addressing the topic, Babajide said, “There are more attacks within the fractions of Boko Haram terrorists than against the military. They have weakened themselves. Sometimes, ISWAP gains the upper hand, while the Shekau fraction gains the upper hand at other times. It depends on where the battle is conducted. Abu Musab al-Barnawi and his men killed Shekau, but Shekau’s men returned to kill Abu Musab al-Barnawi in revenge. Abu Musab al-Barnawi and his men had hoped to access the Sambisa forest.
He continued, “The terrorists have continued to kill each other since the series incidents. This has been an advantage to us, as our army has since gained access to the Sambisa forest. We are progressing, as we do not hear stories of Boko Haram terrorists attacking army formations like we used to. The army is even going on the offensive. However, the problem lies in the North West.
