The Russian troops were advancing from the occupied Kherson region in southern Ukraine, but the counterattack repelled them and also “destroyed” T-72 tanks, helicopters and the Grad multiple rocket system, Oleksandr Vilkul said in a Telegram post late on Sunday.
Kryvyi Rih is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown.
There was no immediate response to Vilkul’s claim from Moscow, and Al Jazeera could not independently verify his report.
