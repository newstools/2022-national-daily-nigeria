Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has honored the country’s most famous dog, Patron, for his dedication.
Patron, a Jack Russell terrier mix, has become a national figure since the Russian invasion for his work with bomb disposal teams in the northern city of Chernihiv. He is credited with uncovering some 150 munitions as one of a team working for the State Emergency Service.
Zelensky presented Patron and his owner, Myhailo Iliev, with the state award “For Dedicated Service” at a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The Chernihiv demining team has used Canadian technology in its work.
At Sunday’s ceremony, Trudeau appeared to search his pockets for treats — but without success.
At previous media appearances, Patron appears to have been unimpressed by the attention his work has generated.
