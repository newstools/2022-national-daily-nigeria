Popular Nigeria media personality and founder of the free Nation Online Church Ifedayo Olarinde best known as Daddy Freeze took to his verified Instagram page to share a new post as he says “My Dear Brother, Which One Is Buy Form For Me After Annoying A Whole Nation?”
According to him, he noted he is advising the famous Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie to kindly go and pay attention to the issues surrounding his matrimonial home before coming to ask Nigerians to finance his Presidential aspiration.
Furthermore, the preacher stated that he is wondering why the actor has to ask for help after how he seems to have upset Nigerians and likewise his wife he married for over 16 years as he asks can anyone trust him again?
Moreso, he affirmed that he is not against polygamy however, he is wondering if Yul Edochie’s courage was for him and the fact that he thinks he may have misled his loved ones. In conclusion, he cited an example as noted that even the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is married to one wife yet people are saying that it is old school.

It may interest you to know that the reason why Daddy Freeze may have felt the need to react the way he did was that the movie producer noted he has an announcement to make today. So, therefore, it seems like he was expecting him to say that the stunt he pulled days ago was a prank and not for him to talk about his Presidential ambition and how people should help out.
Guys, what is your take on this?
