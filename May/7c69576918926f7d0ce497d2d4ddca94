Monday, May 23, is set for the party’s Senate primaries while its governorship primaries will be held on Wednesday, May 25.
The schedule was however silent on the date for the party’s presidential primary election.

“In the case of the South-East region, due to the sit-at-home currently being observed on Mondays, the Senate primaries will now hold on Tuesday, May 24,” the statement added.
