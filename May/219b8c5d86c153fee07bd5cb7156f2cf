The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) new data released at the weekend show that a total of 1,268,008 reports of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and May 13, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
The data included a total of 28,141 reports of deaths — an increase of 173 over the previous week — and 230,364 serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period — up 1,887 compared with the previous week.
There were 6,859 additional total adverse events reported to VAERS over the previous week.
Excluding “foreign reports” to VAERS, 817,538 adverse events, including 12,961 deaths and 82,544 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and May 13, 2022.

Of the 12,961 U.S. deaths reported as of May 13, 16% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 20% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 59% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.
In the U.S., 581 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered as of May 13, including 343 million doses of Pfizer, 219 million doses of Moderna and 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).
The latest release by the FDA of Pfizer vaccine documents raises questions about how frequently adverse events experienced by clinical trial participants were reported as “unrelated” to the vaccine.
The 80,000-page document cache released May 2 includes an extensive set of Case Report Forms (CRFs) from Pfizer trials conducted at various locations in the U.S.
The reports are from participants who suffered some type of adverse event during their participation in Pfizer’s vaccine trials.
As the documents reveal, despite the occurrence of a wide range of symptoms including serious cardiovascular events, almost none were identified as being “related” to the vaccine.
