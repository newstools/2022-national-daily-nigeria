Reactions have trailed the throwback pictures shared by a presidential aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Dele Momodu after he was seen in the pictures with All Progressives Congress (APC) members such as Tinubu, Fayemi, and Gbajabiamila. Dele Momodu posted the pictures with the caption below,
“Hottest throwbacks: Top, left to right, BOLA TINUBU, DELE MOMODU, MANI ONUMONU at Dele’s London home in 1996.”
Left to right: DELE MOMODU treating FEMI GBAJABIAMILA and KAYODE FAYEMI to sumptuous lunch at home in Accra, Ghana, over 15 years ago.”
After these pictures were posted by Dele Momodu, Nigerians troll his page to react as follows:
This is a good reminder that there are no permanent enemies in politics. Dele probably has the same political thoughts as Tinubu and others before decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). These throwback pictures have also proved that Dele Momodu is non-partisan toward building political bridges among people.
