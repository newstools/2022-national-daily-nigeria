Gambo, who resides in Kawo, Kaduna pleaded guilty to conspiracy, impersonation and begged for leniency.
Magistrate Ibrahim Emmanuel gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N20,000.
Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp Chidi Leo told the court that the convict and one other at large, portrayed themselves as court clerk, a representation they knew to be false.
He said the convict and his accomplice are in the habit of collecting money from litigants, pretending to be court officials.
Leo noted that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 57 and 261 of the Kaduna State Penal code.
