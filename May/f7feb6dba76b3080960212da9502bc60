The leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has formally zoned the party’s presidential ticket to the South. The party leadership made the decision on Thursday after a crucial meeting. The decision has put an end to speculations of the ruling APC not willing to rotate the presidency to the South after the eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari from Northwest Nigeria.
There has been threats from some state and political actors from the South who insist that the presidency should be zoned to the South in the 2023 general elections, warning of irreconcilable crisis if the party leaders resolve to retain power in the north.
The formal zoning of the presidency to the south disqualifies Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State from the presidential race.
Meanwhile, the APC has extended the sales of forms for aspirants seeking the ticket of the party for the various elections in 2o23.
Presidential aspirants from the south at the last count include APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Dr. Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun,  Senator Rochas Okorocha,  amongst others.
