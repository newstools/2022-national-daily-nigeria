The video of a young lady known as Ezinne surfaced in the internet after a tragic incident happened to her.
The young lady was seen dancing in front of the hotel, where she was murdered by alleged Yahoo boys in Abakaliki.
According to reports, the suspects are alleged Yahoo boys who murdered her for ritual purposes. Her private part was mutilated alongside another lady who was also lodged with her and the boys.
Ezinne was known as the last surviving child of 10 from her mother. It is so unfortunate that she got into the hands of the evil ones who want to make quick money.
Before the incident, Ezinne made a video of herself dancing just outside the hotel. In another video, she was staring in front of a mirror inside the hotel room with an expensive phone worth more than half a million naira.
It’s just sad that a young girl was deceived and misled by blood sucking humans. The idea that ritual brings wealth is sickening. There is no shortcut to riches.
Some people believed that Ezinne lifestyle was what got her killed. She was so intrigued of living an extravagant lifestyle and nemesis caught up with her.

In my opinion, that might not be the case. There are also lots of innocent girls who get killed. Some get assaulted on the road, then kidnapped.
I just believe the case of Ezinne was not any different. Young girls are prone to danger in the society. Nobody knows who to trust any longer. The priorities of man have shifted to making quick money only. And they don’t care the length taken to make such money.
Until we educate ourselves that there is no such thing as money ritual, then the cases of killings will reduce. Too bad for Ezinne, I hope she gets justice.
