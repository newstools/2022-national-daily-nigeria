After allegedly stepping down for Sen. President Ahmed Lawan, Senator Orji Uzo Kalu has displaced his frustration—and that of Amadioha and other Igbo gods— on V.P Yemi Osinbajo and APC leader Bola Tinubu.
“If they have conscience, they will not run for president. But they have no conscience,” he said in an interview on Channels Monday evening.
According to him, the two southwestern presidential aspirants are greedy; otherwise, they wouldn’t have entered the APC presidential primary contest for the sake of fairness and equity.
“Obasanjo was president for eight years; Osinbajo was vice president for eight years and South Easterners have never been president for one year.”
Kalu boasted last year, after Tinubu declared his interest in the 2023 presidency, that he would match the former Lagos governor naira for naira in the primary.
He, however, withdrew from the race days ago, saying he stepped down for Sen. President Ahmed Lawan.
