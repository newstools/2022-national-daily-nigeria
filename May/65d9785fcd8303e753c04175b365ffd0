The students in their  protest, as in other universities, like UNIBEN,  told the federal government to accept the demands of the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities and allow the universities to reopen.

The students displayed placards to send their messages to the federal government, which include: “End ASUU Strike Now,” among others. They berated the federal government for allowing the strike to last for so long.
The students protested that they are bored of sitting at home; telling the government and ASUU members to consider a middle point of amicable resolution in the interest of the country.
They cautioned that  if the federal government and ASUU do not resolve the crisis by next week, they may  engage on mass protest nationwide.
