The council has now made a statement pushing for peace in Ukraine.
Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s ambassador to the United Nations, called the Security Council statement backing the push for peace in Ukraine “a very first initial step but it points on the right direction”.
“It’s encouraging to see diplomacy is getting its place at the council,” he said, adding that “quiet diplomacy is sometimes much more effective than when you have lots of statements.”
UN chief Guterres also welcomed the statement—as backing his efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine.
The US initially led its allies on the council to mobilize military and economic weapons to defeat Russia, spending over $3 billion first, and with $33bn awaiting US lawmakers’ approval.
But the war, according to the Bank of Europe, is not only costing the rogue state Russia has become; it’s plunging Europe and the world into economic and food crises.
“Today, for the first time, the Security Council spoke with one voice for peace in Ukraine,” Guterres said in a statement.
“The world must come together to silence the guns and uphold the values of the UN Charter.”
