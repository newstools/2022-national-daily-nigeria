Nigerian activist and convener of Bring-back-our-girls, Aisha Yesufu has reacted to the news of former governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant, Peter Obi resigning his membership to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).
Peter Obi in his resignation letter to the People’s Democratic Party yesterday, expressed his dissatisfaction at the party’s leadership.
Interestingly, Aisha Yesufu in her reaction, urged Nigerians to know that the power to choose who presides over the affairs of the nation has always resided in them and not on the political parties. She emphasized that whomever the Nigerian people find worthy of their votes, becomes elected.
“It is not APC and PDP that has always won elections. It is the people! The party the people choose wins!
If the people decide not to choose what is readily available (APC & PDP) & choose what is most beneficial to them, the most beneficial will win.
All it needs is money & time!”
