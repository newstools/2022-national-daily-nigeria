Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike appears to be taking himself seriously after losing to e-V.P Atiku Abubakar who came visiting Monday after the PDP presidential primary on Saturday night.
In his speech on Monday evening, Wike said the north should not claim ownership of the country, saying Nigeria does not belong to a particular geo-political zone.
“We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do. It is a matter of you to be fruitful. We cannot answer second class citizens in Nigeria.
“We just used this one to tell them that enough is enough. We made them not to sleep, we made them not to eat, we made all of them from wherever they think they are coming from to know that there is somebody who can take them on.
“This country does not belong to one particular zone. If people are afraid of talking, it is their business. I cannot be a second class citizen in my country.
“They just want somebody they can control, somebody that will do whatever they want him to do, I will never be a party to that, they only people that can control me are Nigerians not the few people that want to remain in power since the military regime”.
Wike’s former associate and colleague, Gov Aminu Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku hours before the election, making Wike’s defeat a little more crushing.
There were other contestants from the south who refused to step down for Wike. Among them were Akwa Ibom Gov. Emmanuel Udom, e-Gov Peter Obi who would rather pull out, Sam Ohabunwa, and former Gov Ayo Fayose.
