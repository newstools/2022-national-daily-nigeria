Nigerian politician, Joe Igbokwe, has taken to social media to air his opinion, following the request of former aide to Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, that Nigerians should hold the offenders of demised Deborah responsible for the unfortunate incident that led to her death.
Recall that Deborah, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education at Sokoto state, was reportedly killed by some religious fanatics on Thursday, after she made some blasphemous statements about Prophet Mohammad.
However, following the unfortunate death of Deborah, Nigerian activist and former aide to Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, took to his verified Twitter account to reveal that some days ago, two alleged phone thieves were reportedly set ablaze and killed in Lagos State, as he asked the number of persons that blamed Lagosians for such jungle justice mated out on the thieves.
Reno Omokri further stated Deborah’s murder is condemnable, but Nigerians should blame the perpetrators of such act, and not Muslims and Northerners.
However, following Reno Omokri’s statement, special adviser, drainage and water resources in Lagos State, Joe Igbokwe, took to his official Facebook page to react, as he stated Reno Omokri’s statement with regards to Deborah’s unfortunate demise, is another angle of murder case that needs to be looked into.
