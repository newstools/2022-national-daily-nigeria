A presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, former Minister of Transportation, has told Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to step down from the presidential race for the older politicians. Amaechi in Lokoja, Kogi State, to solicit for the support of the APC delegates, emphasis that he has more experience than Governor Bello, and such the governor should withdraw from the presidential race.
Amaechi was joined on the trip by the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai.
Amaechi at the Government House, Lokoja, noted that Governor Bello is qualified to contest for the president, saying that he is still young and, therefore, should step down for him to become the APC candidate. He urged Kogi delegates to persuade Governor Bello to step down his presidential ambition for elderly political like him.
Amaechi declared: “This is the 28th state I will be visiting. I can no longer be called one of the APC aspirants because I have become the leading aspirant.
“I was Speaker at the age of 34, Governor at the age of 42, and a minister in my early 50s. I have acquired the needed experiences to lead Nigeria.
“I am a former Chairman of Speakers forum, two-term Chairman of Governorship forum, coupled with my interaction as Presidential DG campaign, I have what it takes to lead a country like ours.”
He maintained: “I am aware that His Excellency is also a contestant, but I am the only leading contestant, older with more experience and I want to inform him that I will provide him with the necessary experience he needs to govern when the time comes.”
Receiving Amaechi on behalf of Governor Bello, Deputy Governor Edward Onoja encouraged the former minister to visit the governor and deliberate with him. He said that only Governor Bello can tell the delegates the direction to follow.
