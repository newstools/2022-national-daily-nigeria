A former Spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page to caution Nigerians about the recent killing of a Christian female student over blasphemy against the Muslim religion.
The news about a Christian female student, who was said to have been killed as a result of blasphemy against the Muslim religion, has gotten the attention of the Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo-Olu on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe to say that Nigerians in the North, South, East, or West should not fight any religious battle for God or Allah. Stressing that it is unacceptable for ordinary mortals to fight for God or Allah.
According to Joe Igbokwe, he said: “Nigerians in the East, West, North, or South should not fight for God or Allah. The battle is the Lord or Allah. It is reprehensible and unacceptable for ordinary mortals to fight God or Allah’s battles”.
Looking at what Joe Igbokwe said, he believes that no human being or religion has the right to kill a fellow human because of their different religious belief that is why he said that God and Allah can fight their battles themselves.
