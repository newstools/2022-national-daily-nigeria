An aspirant jostling to grab the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), ticket for the House of Representatives at the National Assembly, Mr. Waziri Yahaya Kwande has said if successful in the election, he will use his influence to lobby for jobs at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Central bank.
Kwande said if the people he is coming to represent are given good jobs, the benefits will trickle down to their various family units.
He noted that previous Rep members securing jobs at the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and the Nigeria Police for the youths, has become monotonous, saying that it is time to move up the ladder.
Kwande stated this at the weekend in jos while interacting with our correspondent on what he intends to do if given the opportunity to represent the Plateau Central zone of Qua’an Pan, Shendam and Mikang federal constituency.
According to him: “As a member of the House, you are not only there to make laws but to also lobby effectively and to do this you have to be connected”, he said.
Kwande who was a former Senior Special Assistant to the protocol officer to former president Goodluck Jonathan, said with the experience garnered at the Villa puts him at an advantage to effectively lobby for a better job for his constituents.
“With my experience at the Villa I can get slots for NNPC, Central bank and I can use these slots to help my people. We need to move away from NSCDC and Police jobs and get something better for our people”, he said.
The aspirant who believes his father’s good name and political influence will rub off on him said he is confident that the PDP delegates will give him their mandate to fly the party flag at the forthcoming primary election.
