A well known Nigerian politician, Joe Igbokwe who was the spokesperson of All Progressive Congress, APC, Lagos State chapter has taken to his official Facebook page to reveal why the Presidential candidates are not going to the Southern region.
While sharing on his official Facebook page, the exceptionally boisterous APC supporter, and special adviser to the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on drainage and water resources, Joe Igbokwe made it known that the reason why Presidential candidates are not going to the Southern region is because nobody is interested in the South East anymore, adding that the land is now desolated and abandoned.
Further speaking, Joe Igbokwe stated that the Igbos have deliberately and consciously destroyed Igbo land because of hate and bigotry that took the front seat because President Muhammadu Buhari won the election in the year 2015, adding that if PDP should have won the election in 2015, the country would not have been the way it is now.
Furthermore, Joe Igbokwe lamented, saying that he sees no saving grace or respite in Igbo land until a new generation politically developed, deep thinking, and decent Igbo politicians who will take the center stage.
