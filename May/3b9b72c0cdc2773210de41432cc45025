A man identified as Toba got angry with his girlfriend Tunrayo in their new home in the Mowe area of Ogun, asked her to leave, but later changed his mind, and dispatched her with a broken tile.
But Toba is not a regular man—otherwise a pair of slippers were not worth killing for.
According to reports, the Indian hemp seller asked his girlfriend to go and buy soe alcohol for him, and the lady put on his slippers.
That provoked Toba on her return.
“He told her to pack out of his house, but she kept begging him and when she decided to leave the house, she could not see her slippers. She asked him for the slippers and Toba said he threw them into the bush. She pleaded with him to help her retrieve them from the bush, but he refused,” a resident told Punch.
Efforts to intervene and settle the matter failed.
Toba got angrier. He dragged the girl into a nearby push, and beat her.
Neighbors thought it was just that.
“After a few minutes, I suddenly saw him sitting on the lady. I quickly called people at the site and the son of a chief in our community and they rushed down to arrest him,” the neighbor said.
By then, Tunrayo’s throat had been slashed open with a jagged tile.
