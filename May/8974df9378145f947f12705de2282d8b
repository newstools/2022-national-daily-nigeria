One of Nigeria’s favourite skit makers Investor Sabinus also known as Mr Funny and his legal team are set to sue two popular Nigerian brands namely Peak, who is one of the country’s milk producers and Gala, a sausage-making company.
The report revealed the reason for the legal action against the two companies was because they made use of the comedian’s intellectual property to advertise their products without seeking permission to use it from him.
According to the skit maker’s legal team, the Gala company used Sabinus’ animated picture to promote their products while Peak, used one of his popular comic lines “something hooge”, to promote their products.
In a video that has since gone viral, Sabinus’ legal team disclosed it was sueing Peak and Gala Company for N1 billion and N100 million respectively.
