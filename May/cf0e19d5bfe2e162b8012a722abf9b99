As the 2023 general election draws near, several politicians that have shown interest in taking over from President Muhammad Buhari. More than 25 persons have shown interest from the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) and have purchase presidential form worth a hundred million naira, as well as a few other persons from the People Democratic Party (PDP) and other parties.

However, each flag bearer for the different political parties will be decided after the primaries, which will be coming very soon. All this is one of the reasons why popular Nigerian musician Peter Okoye, also known as PSquare, said that of all the presidential candidates, we all know that it’s only one of them that’s qualified to rule Nigeria, even though he didn’t mention the name of that candidate, as he advised fellow Nigerians to get their permanent voters’ cards (PVC) so they can decide who’ll represent them.
See @PeterPsquare’s tweet below.
“I will still say it again and again! Only one Presidential aspirant is most qualified to be Nigeria’s next President! We all know him, but it’s in the hands of the delegates to do the right thing! We must use common sense in the 2023 election!… Get your PVC.”
