Binani, who is representing Adamawa Central, defeated former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nuhu Ribadu and former governor, Jibrilla Bindow, to emerge the winner of the race.
Mama Taraba in her lifetime was a minister and a governorship candidate in her home state of Taraba on the platform of the United People Democratic Party after she was disqualified from the All Progressives Congress primary election in the 2019 election. Before then, she was the APC governorship candidate in the 2015 election where she came second.
Tweeps have been reacting to Binani’s victory. A Tweep, Ibrahim PhD tweeted, “Nigeria is full of paradoxes, the NE is the most backward region and the only region to produce 2 women as major party ticket holders! The late Mama Taraba and the Hon Binani! All of former Gongola!!”
Setofunmi Alo said, “I pray Sen Aishat Dahiru wins the Adamawa governorship seat next year. She will be the first elected female governor. The victory will be more exciting as this will be coming from the North. The closest female candidate to become a governor was Mama Taraba, also from the North.”
Mavis Ikpeme hailed the senator’s victory, saying, “A female governor in a core northern state. Gender equality finally suppressing religious bias is indeed a welcome development. Mama Taraba!! Senator Aishatu Dahiru Binani, we see your doings !! ”
Enetomhe Stephen said, “The North is the one giving us politically strong women as party candidates, they don’t beg for it but fight to get the ticket. Later(sic) Mama Taraba and now Senator Aisha in Adamawa. May God let her win.”
