A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Mr. Reno Omokri recently took to his social media page and reacted to the arrest of the Accountant General of the Federation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Reno Omokri said,
“Dear ASUU, if the Accountant General of the Federation can steal ₦80 billion, you have no reason to end your strike. Ask Buhari to use the stolen ₦80 billion to pay you and keep the change. After all, the money ASUU is asking for is not even up to ₦80 billion!”


It is unfortunate that the ASUU is still on strike for nonpayments of their allowances while corrupt officials in government cart away such a huge amount of money. Although, an arrest is not synonymous with prosecution and conviction. To date, we’ve had a series of arrests of Government Officials in the present administration but shortly after the matter is swept under for lack of diligence prosecution to earn conviction and this indicates a lack of political will to move away from sentiments attached to these officials while they keep escaping prosecution.
If EFCC could muster the courage displayed by the sister agency NDLEA ùnder General Buba Marwa, Nigeria will be better than this.
