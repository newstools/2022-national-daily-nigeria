A stakeholder in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Dauda Lawal, gas defected to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State.
Dr. Lawal, on defection, declared for the  governorship election in the state on the PDP platform.
Lawal, a former Executive Director at the First Bank PLC, speaking to his supporters at his residence in Gusau, at the weekend, expressed that the APC government at the state and federal levels is a failure. He added that the party is tired and faltering.
He cited insecurity as one of the reasons he joined the governorship contest in Zamfara.
Lawal decried that Zamfara is one of the worst-hit states by insecurity in Nigeria, saying that there is a need to bring the much-needed change in the governance of the state.
Lawal stated: “We all know the challenges we are facing in the area of security.
“Today I can tell you that Zamfara is one of the worst, if not the worst in the area of security and the reality is without security, there will be no meaningful life and we cannot basically do anything.”
Lawal further said: “As we speak today, none of the Zamfara indigenes is going to write WAEC (examination) and you will agree with me that education today is the backbone of everything we do in life; without education, we are nobody,” the governorship aspirant avowed.
“In the area where we have a competitive advantage, which is agriculture, today we are nowhere and as a matter of fact, we are finding it very difficult to even feed ourselves not to consider exporting to our neighbours for commercial activities.”
