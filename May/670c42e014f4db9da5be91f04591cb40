The former FC Porto of Portugal head coach was appointed as AS Roma’s manager in the beginning of the 2021/2022 season, few weeks after being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur football club, and he has been doing a great job since then.
UEFA Europa Conference League was just introduced this season, and the Italian serie A giants have been one of the best teams in the competition, as they’ve won many games.
An early goal from Tammy Abraham was enough to give the home team a deserved victory in the entertaining encounter.
With AS Roma football club’s victory over Leicester City football club, it means Jose Mourinho has become the first manager to reach UEFA competition final with four different clubs.
Reacting to Jose Mourinho’s new record, UEFA posted on their verified Twitter handle that;
“Jose Mourinho is the first manager to reach the final of a major European competition with four different clubs.
FC Porto of Portugal (UEFA Cup and Champions League)
Inter Milan football club of Italy (UEFA Champions League)
Manchester United football club of England (Europa League)
AS Roma football club of Italy (UEFA Europa Conference League).”
The Portuguese will now be looking forward to winning his first trophy with AS Roma football club when they play Feyenoord football club in the final in few weeks time.
