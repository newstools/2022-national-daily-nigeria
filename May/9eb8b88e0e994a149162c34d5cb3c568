Zara Oyinye has reacted to the reports that irate youths attempted to attack the Palace of the Sultan of Sokoto State, His Eminence Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, for condemning the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel and demanding that perpetrators of the evil act must be brought to justice
According to a Vanguard report, the youths who staged a protest to register their displeasure at the detention of some Muslims in connection with Deborah’s murder attempted to attack the Sultan’s Palace but were resisted by security operatives on the ground.
Reacting to this report, Zara Oyinye expressed disappointment that the same youths who haven’t been able to march into Sambisa forest to confront Boko Haram are the ones now bold enough to confront the revered Sultan for speaking the truth.
Deborah Samuel was a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education who was stoned and flogged to death by a mob after she was accused of blasphemy against Prophet Mohammad. Given that no one has the right to take laws into their own hands, President Mohammadu Buhari and other notable leaders have condemned the killing of Deborah and have demanded justice for her. The Sultan is no different and he shouldn’t be disrespected for standing by the truth
