Claims Moslems have red lines

The Imam of National Mosque, Ibrahim Maqari has reacted to the news of the killing of Deborah Samuel by justifying her killer as he asked people not to blame those who killed.
Deborah was a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Wamako, Sokoto State.The Maqari who post this on his social media page according to the “people gazette” said she was killed because she crossed the Islamic red line.
He advised everyone who cares to listen to be careful in their dealings with Muslims as he said, “We the Muslims have some red lines beyond which MUST NOT be crossed”
He emphasized that Prophet Muhammad is one of those red lines and tell people that the dignity of the Prophet (PBUH) is at the forefront.
Ibrahim who obviously wants people to balance their reactions to the incident and not to focus on Deborah’s death alone said, “if our grievances are not properly addressed, then we should not be criticized for addressing them ourselves,”
