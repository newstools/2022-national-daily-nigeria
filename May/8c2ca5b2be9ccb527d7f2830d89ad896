But he still stands his ground.
“I know some [people] feel it. Certainly I spend more time [in Abuja] in this second term in office than I did in my first term in office,” he said when asked on Channels TV yesterday
“But, you know, that shouldn’t bother anyone beyond perception level.”
The governor insisted Nigerian may bother their heads whether his absentee governorship “is telling on my performance as a governor”.
Abuja is where most of the wheeling and dealing about the 2023 presidency have been going since 2019.
Many Nigerians are worried their governors spend more time in Abuja than their states.
The Ekiti PDP have even suggested Fayemi might relocate to Abuja.
