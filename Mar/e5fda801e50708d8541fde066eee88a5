It is no longer news that the former Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, was said to have been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on his way out of Nigeria to the United States after handing over to his successor, Governor Charles Soludo.
Regarding the report, the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor, Sanwo-Olu, on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page and shared EFCC’s statement regarding the reasons why Willie Obiano was arrested.
Joe Igbokwe quoted EFCC’s statement about the arrest of Willie Obiano, stating that “Obiano mismanaged N5 billion Sure-P funds and N37 Billion Security vote”.

It may interest you to know that the N5 billion Sure-p funds are the money that was meant for a scheme that was established by the Federal Government of Nigeria during Good Luck Jonathan’s Administration, to re-direct the Federal Government savings from fuel subsidy removal and safety net programmes with direct impact on the citizens of Nigeria. While the N37 billion security vote is said to be the monthly allowance that is allocated to the 36 States in Nigeria to fund the security services within the States. However, it was gathered that Obiano was unable to manage these funds when he was the governor of Anambra State, which was why he was arrested on his way to Texas.
