The Caretaker Committee Chairman was removed from office on the order of President Muhammadu Buhari who traveled to London, United Kingdom (UK) on Sunday.
Sources from the party secretariat revealed to National Daily that the caretaker committee national chairman was removed from office because of his disagreement with President Buhari on the endorsement of Senator Abdulahi Adamu from Nasarawa State for national chairman of the party.
In addition to the disagreement with the President on Adamu, Governor Buni was also said to be removed because of uncomfortable malfeasance and tendencies in his leadership style.
Meanwhile, APC stakeholders across Nigeria are awaiting the outcome of the emergency meeting currently going in Abuja; while President Buhari is in the UK.
