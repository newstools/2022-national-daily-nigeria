Minister for Aviation, Hadi Sirika has kicked against the bill passed by the Senate to alter the provisions of Nigeria’s constitution to move Airports from Exclusive legislative to the concurrent list.
In his presentation, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Smart Adeyemi, argued that the bill aims to provide an effective legal and institutional framework for the regulation of civil aviation in Nigeria.
This, according to him, will ensure the industry conforms to the standards and recommended practices set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

He added that the piece of legislation would, among others, establish rules of operation and divisions of responsibility within the Nigerian civil aviation system to promote aviation safety.
According to him, it would “ensure that Nigerians obligations under International aviation agreements are implemented; and consolidate the laws relating to civil aviation in Nigeria.”
During voting, 82 senators voted to have it placed on concurrent list, while only two voted against the bill.
But reacting in a tweet on his official handle, Sirika said Aviation is sensitive, and a sovereignty matter, therefore should be the sole responsibility of the federal government.
“Constitutional amendment, I think NASS got it wrong. Aviation on concurrent list? Interesting. I can’t relate/figure out a concurrent airspace. Would be the first on planet earth, I think. Aviation is a Sovereignty matter as well as a National security concern,” he tweeted.
