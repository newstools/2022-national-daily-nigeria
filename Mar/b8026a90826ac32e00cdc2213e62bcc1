The Federal Government of Nigeria has announced plans to implement the court judgement allowing political appointees to run for office without resigning.
Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, made the government’s position known in a statement recently.
FG’s announcement came hours after a Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, on Friday, nullified Section 84(12) of the newly amended Electoral Act, saying it violated the provisions of the Constitution.
It has been reported that Malami; the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; and other political appointees believed to interested in elective offices will not be able to participate in the All Progressives Congress primaries expected to begin in May unless they resign.

The Senate had earlier unanimously rejected the Electoral Act Amendment Bill sent by President Muhammadu Buhari.
However, elected officers including governors, deputy governors, the Vice-President and members of the National Assembly and the state legislature will be allowed to contest and participate in the primaries.
Section 84(10) of the Act specifically reads, “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.”
