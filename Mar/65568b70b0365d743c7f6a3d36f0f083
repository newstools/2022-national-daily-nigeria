It also said that areas to the north remained among the most dangerous, including the suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, as well as the district of Vyshorod further north from the capital.
The administration highlighted fresh fighting in settlements around Brovary, which is across the Dnieper River, east from the capital.
“Evacuation through humanitarian corridors from Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and Borodianka is planned today,” the administration said, after limited success in evacuating civilians from those areas Wednesday.
Separately, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Ukrainian television that “the key goal of the Russians is to capture Kyiv.”
“Their task from the first day of war is to surround Kyiv, to encircle it and then continue to attack, overthrow the government,” he said.
“Their plans are not being realized, thanks to our guys who are now in Bucha, Vorzel, Irpin, Hostomel, where fierce fighting is taking place. Our guys are thwarting all plans to surround Kyiv,” Klitschko said.
He also discussed refugees leaving the capital.
“Every second Kyiv resident has left the city, there are just a bit less than two million residents now in Kyiv,” he said, adding, “now Kyiv has become a fortress, every street and every building.”
