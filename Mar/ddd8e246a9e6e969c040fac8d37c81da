An elder statesman and one of the elders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olabode George has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Electoral Act into law, not that the amended act will improve the country’s elections in 2023.
Bode George, however, expressed strong opposition to the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, aspiring to be the president of Nigeria.
The elder statesman doubted the integrity of the APC leader aspiring to succeed President Buhari in 2023. Bode George vowed that he would rather   leave Nigeria and watch from afar if Tinubu becomes President.
Bode George at a media briefing in Lagos highlighted in part: “I am happy the President has signed the new electoral bill.
“If by whatever chance he gets to the Villa, I won’t be part of this country. “And I am not joking. I can go to Ghana and be watching with binoculars from afar. You will see what will happen.
“This is Alpha-Beta in Lagos. He will create some Alter-Beta somewhere to carry your money. His wife will now be Senate President. His son will be Governor of Lagos. His daughter will be Iyaloja of Nigeria.
“What has he done to prove that he deserves to be honoured by anybody in this country?”
Bode George has always been opposed to Tinubu becoming Nigeria’s president with insinuations of questionable probity. He had at different timers raised critical issues about the former Lagos State governor, and has been steadfast in his arguments and opposition to Tinubu’s presidential ambition.
