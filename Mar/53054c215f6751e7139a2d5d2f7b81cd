The attack came after the governor offered to work with the separatist group to move the state forward.
Now he vowed the state won’t surrender to criminals, adding the mindless bloodletting and destruction of infrastructure does not define who the people are.
“Nothing can justify these acts of criminality. As I looked at what is left of the rubble, I asked myself, “in all this, who loses?” Soludo said.
“Structures built from the taxes paid by the genuinely hard-working men and women on the streets are ruined for reasons that are incomprehensible to sane minds.”
He said it is very impossible to make any meaningful progress this way.
“Quite frankly, ndị Anambra cannot be repressed by a few criminal elements.
“Our resolve to entrench law and order is total, no amount of wanton destruction will cower us,” he said.
It was the same LGA where hoodlums murdered his police guards – Inspector Murtala Saudi, Sgt. Mudassir Ahmed, Sgt. Samuel Ishaya – in 2021 at a meeting with youths in his village.
