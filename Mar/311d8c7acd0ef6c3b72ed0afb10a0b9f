Anambra former first lady has finally opened up on the fistfight between her and Bianca Ojukwu during the inauguration of Gov. Charles Soludo.
Ambassador Bianca let fly a slap in Obiano’s face, and justified her decision to ward off the harassment.
According to her, the former first lady came drunk, reeking of whiskey, to the occasion, and heaped unprintable words on her, going as far as pulling the wig of the former beauty queen.
But according to a statement by her spokesperson, Chidiebele Obika, the former governor’s wife said, all she did was approach the former beauty queen for their usual friendly banters only to be slapped and pushed by her.
She wondered what brought about “so much anger and hate” that would cause a former diplomat to be unable to “manage herself in public”.
Mrs. Obiano stated that she didn’t bother returning the slap, instead, she walked away in bewilderment.
