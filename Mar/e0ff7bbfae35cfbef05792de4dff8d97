While one primary election took place at the Osogbo City Stadium, a faction held a parallel Governorship election at WOCDIF Event Center.
However, the exercise at the stadium was supervised by a committee from the national secretariat of the party led by the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa state, Mr Lawrence Oborawharievwo Ewhrudjakpo.
Six aspirants, including Mr Ademola Adeleke, Prince Dotun Babayemi, Alhaji Fatai Akinbade, Mr Dele Adeleke, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, and Mr Omirin Emmanuel Olusanya were on the race for the PDP ticket and the Mohammed Adoke-led screening committee from the PDP National Secretariat cleared all of them for the contest.
However, four aspirants, Ogunbiyi, Dele, Omirin and Akinbade opted out.
The members of the party at the stadium are supporters of Adeleke while those supporting Babayemi were at the parallel primary.
