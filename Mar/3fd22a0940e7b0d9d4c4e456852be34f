As the 2023 presidential election continues to draw closer, many parties have been taking steps that might help them a lot in the coming election to remain or hijack the presidential seat.
However, based on the current situation in Nigeria, there are two politicians in the APC party that PDP who are looking forward to producing the next president of the country may lure to their party in order to boost their chances in the coming election.

Governor Mai Buni
Currently, Mai Buni is not well settled in the APC after the party abruptly removed him as acting chairman. The PDP has already sympathized with him and declared the action of the APC to be wrong and not constitutionally legit.
The next step of the PDP may be to attempt to lure him into their party by offering him a tangible post that may be hard to resist. If PDP successfully lures him, it will be a win-win situation for them because, apart from the fact that Mai Buni is one of the APC cabals, he is also the Governor of Yobe State, which may guarantee a win for PDP in Yobe State in the 2023 election.

Rauf Aregbesola
This current Minister may also be feeling uncomfortable in the APC ever since he had a misunderstanding with the National Chairman of the Party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
Since the misunderstandings, Aregbesola’s anointed politician has been knocked out of the primary, and he has also been humiliated in Lagos, where some people carried his coffin, claiming that his feud with Tinubu would affect him politically.

However, the PDP party, knowing that Aregbesola may not be comfortable again, especially with a governor that seems to be working against his interest in Osun, may go for him with their attempt to lure him to their party by offering him a tangible post.
