Acting Zonal Coordinator, South-West Zonal Office, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), confirmed the development in a statement issued on Wednesday.
Ibrahim Farinloye said the explosion occurred at a Mobil Petrol Station about 1pm, and it  destroyed  the residential building located at No. 71, Agege Motor Road, Alakara, Mushin, Lagos.
According to him, no life was lost and no one was injured. Containment of the fire has been very successful.
“Efforts are ongoing to salvage the three-storey building from being totally consumed,” he said.
“The few items that were saved have been deposited at the Alakara Police Station which is opposite the building.”
According to him, the Mobil Filling Station has been sealed-off by the Lagos State Safety Commission.
“Presently, out of the 33,000 litres of four compartments, the explosion started while only one compartment was being discharged,” he said.
“With total control of the fire, the remaining three compartments are being discharged to ensure the safety of the community.”
He noted that though the cause of the explosion is yet to be ascertained, it was a reminder of the need for Nigerians to be very careful in the handling of gasoline.
Farinloye said this was especially due to the current dry season and excessive heat when little pressure could lead to a fire outbreak.
Agencies on the ground at the scene were NEMA, Federal and State Fire Services, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, and the Disaster Management Unit of the Lagos State Police Command.
