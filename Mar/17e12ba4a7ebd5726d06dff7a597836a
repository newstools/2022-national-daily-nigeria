The Black Stars of Ghana on Tuesday at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja, knocked out the Super Eagles of Nigeria from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Ghana outplayed the nigerian in the second leg of the qualifier game with 1-1 result in Nigeria.
The first leg in Kumasi played last week ended 0-0.  Ghana qualified on away goal rules.
Thomas Partey of Ghana scored Ghana’s winning goal in the 11th minute of the match. Nigeria’s Captain, Troost Ekong, scored the equalizing goal in about the 37th minute through penalty.
Victor Osiemhen’s goal in the second half that lifted the hope of victory for the Nigerian team was ruled offside.
Nigeria clearly lost the game from the bench. The goalkeeper, Uzoho, was on holidays to give out the early goal to Ghana. The midfield was empty and the players in that section were not on duty. The defenders were over laboured and had to be sending long passes from the back direct to the attackers who were already choked with Ghana’s packed defence.
The technical crew found comfort in defeat and could not make wise decisions when necessary to change the game. Apart from the defence, virtually everything was wrong with the selection. Those who question the competence of Austin Eguavon to be Nigeria’s coach may have been proved right by the defeat of Nigeria by Ghana on Nigerian soil after the goalless draw in Ghana.
Odion Ighalo, Ahmed Musa, etc, were brought into the game in the 81st minute.
Ghana was thrown into wild celebration at the blast of the final whistle on the Nigerian soil.
