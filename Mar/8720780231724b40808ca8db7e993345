Former Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Chief James Ajibola Ige, is trending on social media on Sunday after the emergence of impeached deputy governor of Osun, Senator Iyiola Omisore.
Many users have taken to social media especially the term to refer to the celebrated killing of the nation’s number one law officer who was killed in his Bodija, Ibadan residence in December 2001.
The newly installed National Secretary of the APC, Omisore was one of those prosecuted over the killing of the former minister who was also once Governor of the old Oyo State.
The case against Omisore and others had gone on for months at the Oyo State High Court until a nolli prosecui was entered in their favour by the Ministry of Justice under the administration of Alhaji Rasidi Ladoja.
A Twitter handles Adesina Adeyemi with the handle @yomideolu said “those who wanted to capture south-west in 2003 killed Bola Ige. There is no way a serving AGF can be killed the way Uncle Bola was, without support from the highest level.”
Another handle used by London-based Nigerian activist, Kayode Ogundamisi, wrote “Apparently, nobody killed Bola Ige again. All is forgiving on a platter of ambition. What is the first lesson in politics again? Particularly Nigerian politics.”
Several times, the governments of APC both at state and federal levels had moved to reopen the murder case.
While some argued on social media that Omisore cannot be held responsible for the killing of Ige, others argued that events in Osun had suggested culpability.
