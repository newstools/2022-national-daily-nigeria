Sirika made this claim at the World Government Summit in Dubai, during a panel discussion focused on the future of global aviation. The discussion was moderated by Richard Quest.
In a video shared on the handle of the Federal Ministry of Aviation, Sirika said, “Nigeria is a candidate for national carrier. A private carrier. 100 per cent private, no government control, no membership of board, totally private and committed to the private sector.”
This comes after the Aviation Ministry revealed it has applied for an NCAA Air Transport license grant for Nigeria Air Limited.
