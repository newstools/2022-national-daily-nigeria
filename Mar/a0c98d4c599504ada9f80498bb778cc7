Indications have emerged that the Senator representing Imo West Senatorial district, Rochas Okorocha may not get a good opportunity to pursue his presidential ambition under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of the 2023 general elections.
The former Imo State Governor who declared his presidential ambition in January had said that “poverty is the root cause of all the problems Nigeria is facing” and that he was the right man to alleviate this poverty. He also boasted that if given the opportunity to govern Nigeria in 2023, he would beat President Buhari’s record
However, if the recent speculation is anything to go by, Rochas Okorocha may soon pitch his camp with his former party, the Peoples Democratic Party.
According to National Daily report, the decision-makers in the APC have allegedly agreed to zone the party’s presidential ticket to the southwest region while the southeast region is favoured to produce the next Senate President.

Rochas Okorocha will most likely lose woefully if he swims against the tide and contests for the APC’s presidential ticket. My pragmatic assumption is that, rather than fight a battle he is very likely to lose, Rochas Okorocha may join the PDP where he will have a level-playing field to contest for the opportunity to become the party’s presidential flag-bearer




Recall that at the press conference where Rochas officially declared his intention to run for president, he kicked against zoning of political offices in the APC and urged the party to allow a level-playing ground for candidates from all six geopolitical zones.
Going by the alleged decision of the APC to micro-zone its presidential ticket to the southwest region, rather than shelve his presidential ambition Rochas who is from the southeast may join the PDP which hinted that it would throw its presidential ticket open to aspirants no matter their region
