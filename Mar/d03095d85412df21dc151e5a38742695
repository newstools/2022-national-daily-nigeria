A well known Nigerian politician, Joe Igbokwe who was the spokesperson of All Progressive Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter has taken to his official Facebook page to lament regarding the incident that happened during the swearing-in ceremony of the new governor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo.
Recalled that during the swearing-in ceremony of Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, the wife of outgoing governor Willie Obiano, Ebelechukwu, created a sense after she allegedly slapped Mrs. Bianca Ojukwu.
Reacting to this incident, the exceptionally boisterous APC supporter, and special adviser to the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on drainage and water resources, Joe Igbokwe made it known that it was a very unfortunate day in Anambra State, adding that a day which was meant to be a day of joy turned into a day shame and political stupidity.

This is sad and unfortunate, I don’t see any reason why a public figure like Ebelechukwu and Bianca would create such a sense during an important day like that.
Permit me to say this, I think these women owns the people an apology for what they did.
What is your view on this?.
