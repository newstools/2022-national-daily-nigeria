According to him, this afternoon, I received with shock the passing away of one of my great supporters, Evangelist Chinedu Nwadike, one of Nigeria’s best Gospel artists who was suffering from kidney failure and leukemia.
He says that Chinedu was a member of the Imo State Government Administration under His Excellency, Owelle Rochas Okorocha and performed creditably in his office as the Special Assistant on Mobilization. He was also an active member of my Campaign Organization and supported me all through the 2019 Governorship Campaigns.

Continuing, Uche Nwosu says that as soon as Chinedu was hospitalized at the National Hospital in Abuja, His Excellency, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, himself and members of his political family intervened to ensure that he had the best of medical attention and to rescue him from death.
But unfortunately, Chinedu Nwadike died this afternoon after preparing travel documents for his two brothers to fly with him to India for further treatment. His death is not only a great loss to us but to the entire Christian community in Nigeria.
