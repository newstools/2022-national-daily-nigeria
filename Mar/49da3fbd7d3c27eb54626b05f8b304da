The former Spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page and reacted to Wike’s declaration to contest for 2023 presidential race. Joe Igbokwe said,
“Somebody should help me tell somebody that Abuja is not River State”.
The truth is that Wike has declared, he wants to be president, it will be interesting. He chose Benue. While declaring he threw a jab at Saraki. Talking about a failed bank. Then he said that he is an employer of labor too. Perhaps like Atiku. He said his house everybody is an employer of labor.
Nigerians have commended Governor Nyesom Wike for his boldness and courage to declare to run for the office of the President under the platform of his party. Hate or like him, he has made his statement and that is the courage required at this level of politics. All those interested in the office should also declare so Nigerians can assess and subject them to scrutiny. The office in question is the biggest in the land and Nigerians shouldn’t be having muted ambition.
