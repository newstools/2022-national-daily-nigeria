The Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, in Abuja, berated male legislators in the National Assembly, saying they have no regard for women when they voted against gender bills requiems to amend the constitution.
Paulin Tallen stated further: “It clearly shows that the men that were against the bill don’t have any respect for women; it’s clear. “But I am not generalising; not all the men in the National Assembly. We have the figures — 72 men in the House of Representatives voted in support of the bill.”
The minister disclosed that Nigerian women are already working out modalities on subsequent plans to uphold the rights of women.
