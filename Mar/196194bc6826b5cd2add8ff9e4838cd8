The Federal High Court, Maitama, Abuja, on Wednesday sentenced Mohammed Sani Zubair to two years’ imprisonment over N180 million fraud.
The presiding judge of the Federal High Court, Maitama, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, convicted Mohammed Sani Zubair to two years imprisonment with an option of fine of N400,000 after he pleaded guilty to the charges.  Zubair was identified as a serial fraudster; he was first arraigned on October 8, 2018, on four counts relating to fraudulent activities.
The convict was a member of a syndicate that specialised in defrauding people. Mohammed Sani Zubair had defrauded a retired Army General to the tune of N180.000, 000.
According to the commission, one of the counts read: “That you, Mohammed Sanni Zubair on or about October 2016, in Abuja, within the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal High Court of Nigeria, did make a statement to Naziru Aminu Shehu, an officer of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), in the course of the exercise of the duties of his office, contained in your written statement dated 28th October, 2016, which you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 39 (2) (a) and (b) of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004”.
Zubair pleaded “not guilty” when the charges were read to him. Based on his plea, prosecution counsel, Richards Dauda, prayed for an accelerated hearing of the matter. Defence counsel, O. F Ekengba did not oppose the prayers. The trial lasted four years with the prosecution counsel presenting many witnesses.
The children of Major General Geoffrey Ejiga (retd) petitioned the EFCC, complaining that a syndicate of fraudsters defrauded their father of over N180 million.
