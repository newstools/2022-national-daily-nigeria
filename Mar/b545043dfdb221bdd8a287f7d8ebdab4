Senator Shehu Sani on Thursday mocked those governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who supported the plot to remove the national chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, who was in the UAE on medical vacation. The group of governors had plotted the takeover of the CECPC leader of the APC by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, who is the deputy national chairman of CECPC.
Bello had claimed to bed on charge of the APC CECPC last week. Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State had in television interview said that Buni will not return of APC CECPC national chairman, adding that APC governors had approved the change of leadership.
However, the game changed after the INEC insistence on the rule of law, particularly, time frame for notifications on NEC meetings and party conventions.
This was reinforced by the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to direct APC stakeholders to restore the status quo.
Accordingly, Governor Buni, who is still in Dubai, on Wednesday ordered the cancellation of the APC emergency NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday.
Senator Shehu Sani on his official twitter handled mocked the failure of the leadership change in the APC, saying “Baba used NATO troop from za UK to crush za coup.”
The tweet was, however, later deleted.
