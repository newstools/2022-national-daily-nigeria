Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State has insisted that he is the new national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. Governor Bello imposed himself as the party’s national leader when he stormed the APC secretariat on Sunday.
The action unsettled the APC caretaker leadership battling for survival. However, the removal of Governor Buni was approved by President Muhammadu Buhari before he traveled to the UK on medical vacation for two weeks.
Governor Bello in a tweet declared: “I am currently presiding over the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC at the National Secretariat of the Party.”
Governor Buni in a statement on Monday morning by the CECPC National Secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe, disputed his removal, saying he is still the APC national chairman.
The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).
“The media report is fake news and should be disregarded.
“The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by ‘sources’ through name dropping in the media.
“We urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.”
The party leaders are currently in an emergency meeting in Abuja.
