No matter what kind of medicine you take, whether OTC (over-the-counter) or prescription, it is destined to take a trip through your kidneys. Taking a drug the wrong way or in excessive amounts can damage these vital, bean-shaped organs and lead to serious complications. In the worst-case scenario, it could necessitate a kidney transplant.
According to Cleveland clinic, here are medications that can damage the kidney when used carelessly.
Vancomycin
Patients with severe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are often treated with the IV antibiotic, vancomycin. Because this medication can cause kidney damage and acute interstitial nephritis (swelling in the kidneys) in some patients, your doctor will closely monitor your kidneys for any injury while treating your infection.
Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)
These medications (Aciphex, Nexium, Prilosec, Prevacid) are used to treat heartburn, ulcers, and acid reflux. They lower the amount of acid in your stomach, but studies have shown that taking them for a long time can raise your chances of serious kidney problems and possibly lead to kidney failure.
Antiviral drugs
Antivirals such as acyclovir, which is used for herpes, chickenpox and shingles and Valtrex (valaciclovir), a herpes treatment, may lead to kidney swelling and inflammation and can also produce those pesky crystals that won’t dissolve. Medications can cause inflammation in several parts of the kidney, often resulting from an immune reaction or allergic response.
