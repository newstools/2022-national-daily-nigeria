A pregnant 27-year-old woman has been arrested for keeping a coffin full of human blood in her room. Her husband, the true owner of the suspected sakawa item, is on the run.
According to Angel TV Journalist Bismark Mensa, some household members in Mperhin, a suburb of Offinso, we’re unable to breathe due to a foul and offensive odor emanating from the room of the pregnant woman and her husband. The woman shared that room with her husband, Kwesi.
The members of the household approached the couple to find out what was causing the foul odor in their room. Their room was forcibly broken into despite the couple’s fierce resistance. A brown Coffin, as frightening as it appeared, was reportedly seen containing human blood. When Kwesi, the pregnant woman’s husband, sensed danger, he fled, leaving his wife behind.

The Ghana Police Service was quickly dispatched to prevent the pregnant woman from being beaten or lynched. She was handcuffed and taken to Offinso Police Station for further investigation.

The investigation will reveal more about how the couple obtained such a large amount of human blood and stored it in a coffin.


As the story progressed, it became clear that the suspect on the run (Kwesi) is a self-proclaimed money ritualist. He appears on numerous private television stations under the guise of a powerful spiritualist.
Meanwhile, he is said to have duped his victims. The most recent report concerned his encounter with a well-known man (name withheld) in the Offinso neighborhood. Kwesi duped him out of 7000 Ghana cedis under the guise of money doubling and giving him power over evil spirits.
