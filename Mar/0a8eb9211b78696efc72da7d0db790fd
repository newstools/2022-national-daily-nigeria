Vice President Yemi Osinbajo canceled his earlier schedule to visit Lagos State on Tuesday for the Tinubu’s 70th birthday colloquium; he rather rescheduled his itineraries to go to Kaduna State following bandits attack on Kaduna bound train from Abuja.
The media aide to the Vice-President, Laolu Akande, had disclosed that Osinbajo was on his way to Lagos for the 13th Tinubu Colloquium before making a detour to Kaduna.
According to Akande, “On his way to Lagos for the 13th Tinubu Colloquium marking former Lagos State Governor’s 70th birthday, VP had to detour to Kaduna this afternoon on receiving news of the extent of human and material losses occasioned by yesterday’s dastardly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna railway route.”
The bandits killed some passengers, kidnapped many others, while several were injured during the attack on an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train conveying hundreds of travelers.
Vice President Osinbajo was received at Kaduna Airport by Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
The vice president also visited victims of the attack at 44 Nigerian Army Reference hospital and Saint Gerald’s Catholic hospital both in Kaduna.
Vice President Osinbajo in a tweet @ProfOsinbajo wrote: “I am saddened by another mindless terrorist attack on citizens. We must for our nation and their memories fight on and defeat the cowards who unleash terror on those not armed. They will not break our spirits and our resolve. We will prevail & our land will be secure.”
