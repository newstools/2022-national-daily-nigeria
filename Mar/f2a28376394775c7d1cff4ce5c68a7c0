Former President of the United States (U.S.), Donald Trump has requested President Vladimir Putin of Russia to release dirt on President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, including the laptop deleted messages earlier leaked by a journalist.
Trump in a media interaction with John Solomon and Amanda Head on the “Just the News” show on Real America’s Voice network, declared: “One thing, while I’m on your show, as long as Putin now is not exactly a fan of our country, let him explain, where did – because Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask the question – why did the mayor of Moscow’s wife give the Bidens, both of them, $3.5 million dollars? That’s a lot of money.
“I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.”
Trump was said to be making reference to a controversial 2020 Senate GOP report on President Biden and Hunter Biden, which resulted in little proof of wrongdoing.
Trump has continued to allege that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the late mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov.
