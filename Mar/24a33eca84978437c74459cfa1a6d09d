Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has revealed how the ousted Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and some rebels in the party conspired to postpone the ruling party’s National Convention scheduled for March 26, 2022.
El-Rufai, who appeared on Channels Television on Wednesday evening, March 9, 2022, said Buni’s lawyers got a court injunction to postpone the national convention till May 2022.
When other governors discovered Buni’s plan, they quickly informed President Muhammadu Buhari, who ordered his immediate removal and the installation of Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State as the acting chairman.
El-Rufai added that the Buni-led caretaker committee also refused to implement some recommendations and zoning arrangements signed by President Buhari. He concluded that 19 APC governors and Buhari were in support of Buni’s removal.
Also, Salihu Lukman, former director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), revealed that Buni betrayed the trust of President Buhari, which led to his removal.
According to Lukman, when Buhari gives you a responsibility, he doesn’t micromanage you. Buhari trusted Buni to lead the ruling party, but he fumbled. He believed Buhari would never call him to say, “Don’t do this.”
Why is Buni trying to stop the APC convention?
