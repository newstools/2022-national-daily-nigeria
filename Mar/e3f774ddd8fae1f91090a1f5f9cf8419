As the campaign for the 2023 General Elections heats up, there are signs that the APC Vice-Presidential Candidate could come from the Northern region. Simon Lalong, the incumbent Governor of Plateau State, is one of the top politicians to keep an eye on.
Below is the two reasons why the ruling APC may consider Lalong for the top position:
(1) Marginalization of the North-Central since 1999
The North-Central has yet to produce a President and Vice-President since Nigeria’s restoration to democracy in 1999. It should be remembered that the North-East produced Atiku Abubakar as Vice-President, while the North-West produced Namadi Sambo as Vice-President and Muhammadu Buhari as President in that order. As a result, Lalong could be a contender for the top spot.

(2) Vast Political Experience
Lalong has been active in politics since 1999, serving as Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly prior to his election as Governor of Plateau State in 2015. As a result, he possesses the necessary political experience to become the APC Vice-Presidential Candidate in 2023.
