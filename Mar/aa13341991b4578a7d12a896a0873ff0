Actress, Olaide Oyedeji, has urged her fans to reconsider ‘billing’ her because of the price of fuel in Nigeria.



In a video shot at a fuel station in Germany, the actress said that she now pays over two Euros per litre of fuel. A price, she said was more than she used to pay for the product in the past.



Oyedeji said, “I’m not saying what is happening right now in Nigeria on the matter is fuel is acceptable. I’m just trying to explain something to you people. What is happening in Lagos is also happening here (Germany). Don’t tell me that because petrol is now expensive in Lagos, you want to turn me into a ‘client’ and start billing me, it will not work.”
