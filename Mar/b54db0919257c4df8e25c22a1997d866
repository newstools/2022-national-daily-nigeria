Mariah was coming back from her WAEC extra mural class in Ekiti in March 2019. She reared up three years later, eight month pregnant, and chronically addled.
The state police command arrested one Adewunmi and his mother as responsible for Mariah’s state.
It was a tip off on March 15 that brought Maria’s mother and the police to Adewunmi’s family.
The police spokesman in the state, ASP Sunday Abutu, said investigation revealed that the victim was lured by Adewumi into his mother’s house and drugged her on the day she disappeared.
“The victim said after consuming the drugs given to her by Adewumi, she could not remember to go back home. She said she is now a drug addict due to the amount of drugs consumed within the three years of her enslavement,” Abutu said.
“Adewumi had series of sexual intercourse with her and has given her to different men on many occasions each time he did not have money, who had sex with her and paid him between N10,000 and N20,000.”
Abutu added that investigation revealed that the victim was about eight months pregnant.
Adewumi confessed to the crimes and that he and his mother would be charged to court for conspiracy to wit abduction, rape and child exploitation.
