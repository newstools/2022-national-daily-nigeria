According to him, the football game was organised by the pro-Tinubu group in collaboration with the Lagos State Government.
Ibrahim further stated that the 13th Bola Tinubu Colloquium, which happens every year, would follow the novelty match.
NATIONAL DAILY reports that Tinubu, a foremost chieftain of the ruling APC, had in January 2022, declared to run for the 2023 Presidency.
Tinubu will be 70 years old on March 29, 2022, meaning that he would be 79, the current age of President Muhammadu Buhari, when he leaves office by 2030, that is, if he eventually wins his party’s sole ticket and goes on to win the presidential election.
