In a report published by Daily Post, the former Governor of Lagos State, and National leader of the All Progressive Congress APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has during his recent visit to the palace of the Ataojo of Osogbo, Jimoh Olanipekun, stated that he doesn’t need physical strength to be Nigeria’s President in 2023. According to him, what he needs more is psychological strength, to solve the challenges facing Nigeria.
In his words, Bola Tinubu said thus:
“I am not applying for the job of bricklaying or grave digging. I went to school to study accountancy and management.
I am applying for a thinking job and I will do it right. The job I want to do is for Nigeria to be greater and to be proud of itself”.
In my opinion, Tinubu shouldn’t have made such a statement for the following reasons:
1. The first reason why Tinubu shouldn’t have made such a statement is that in all fairness, he does need physical strength as much as he needs psychological strength, to be Nigeria’s President.

This is because the tasks expected of a Nigerian President are numerous such that even President Muhammadu Buhari confessed weeks ago that he has been working long hours and can’t wait to leave office in 2023 so that he can rest.
2. Secondly, as we may know, one of the arguments that have been raised by the critics of Bola Tinubu, is that he is not strong enough to undertake the responsibilities demanded of a Nigerian President.
Taking these into consideration, Tinubu’s statement that he doesn’t need physical strength to become president seems to have given backing to such claims.
In my opinion, this is not good for his campaign going into 2023 as Nigerians will be looking for someone who is not just psychologically strong, but also physically capable of handling the seat of the Presidency.
