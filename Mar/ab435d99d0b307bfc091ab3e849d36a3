Chairman of Dangote Group of company, Aliko Dangote has shared some titbits on what Nigerians should expect from his refinery scheduled to begin operation anytime soon.


Dangote spoke to Arise News Correspondent during a special documentary report at the site in Ibeju Lekki Lagos while the exclusive interview was aired on the Monday edition of Good Morning Show.
According to the billionaire businessman, the Refinery when completed will meet the total demands of Nigerians for fuel. It will not only refine Petroleum Motor Spirit, PMS but will also refine Aviation fuel, Liquified gas and other products.

Dangote noted that once the operation commences, it will help the Nigerian government build its Foreign reserve since the crude oil will now be refined locally. He frowned at idea of producing crude oil and export it outside the country where it will be refined with a huge amount of money in dollars.
He said no country can make progress under such a situation.
Asking why he chose to invest such a huge amount of money in Nigeria and not somewhere else, Dangote disclosed that he is passionate about Nigeria’s development. He said he wants to see the country that is doing well in all areas of economy
He disclosed that he could have kept his money in bank outside the country like other big men and money bags in Nigeria but he decided to invest it here because he is very passionate about the country.
He was also of the opinion that the only way to make the country grow is by everyone to contribute his quota without having to wait for government’s intervention on everything.
