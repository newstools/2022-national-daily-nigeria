This was made known at a joint press briefing in Kaduna on Sunday by the Zamfara State Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, and the Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, retired DIG Mamman Ibrahim Tsafe, on the state of affairs in Zamfara.
They said  the state government has recruited 4,200 Community Protection Guards (CPG), comprising of ex-servicemen, volunteer able bodied men and other patriotic citizens.
The commissioners said the CPG will be supporting the state security operatives to confront the bandits in their enclaves, with a view to curtailing their menace.
The CPGs have already commenced the basic training and are now collaborating with security operatives chasing the bandits.
According to them, in spite of activities of unpatriotic conflict entrepreneurs, Zamfara State would soon reclaim its lost glory as one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria.
The officials said there are some unpatriotic, conflict entrepreneurs politicians hell bent on sabotaging peace process out of their selfish desire either to gain power.
“To buttress this claim, the Zamfara State Government recently hosted a mammoth crowd in Gusau, the state capital, from within and outside the state who came and lived in Gusau for a week without a single act of banditry against our visitors.
“Interestingly, not a single visitor was troubled either on his way coming or going back to their destinations,” they added.
