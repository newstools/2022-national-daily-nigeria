“Refugees from Ukraine do not need to go through the asylum procedure. They will receive immediate protection in the EU for up to three years.”
The minister went on to say that the refugees were provided with immediate access to health insurance and the labour market.
Last Thursday, Russia launched a special operation to “denazify” Ukraine, responding to calls for help from the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.
The Russian Defence Ministry said that the special operation was targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only.
However, more than half a million refugees have left Ukraine already, according to the UNHRC.
