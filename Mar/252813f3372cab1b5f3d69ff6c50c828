The liver is undoubtedly one of the most important organs of the human body. Located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, the liver is responsible for multiple functions including metabolic and synthetic functions. Therefore, it is essential to note all the signs of liver disease carefully to identify any occurrence immediately.

Liver disease is a broad term that can describe any issue that damages the liver and affects its function. Possible causes include infections, genetic conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.
According to Cleveland clinic, here are signs of liver disease that can be seen on the legs and skin.
Yellow skin (Jaundice)
Yellow skin caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice may occur if the liver can’t efficiently process red blood cells as they break down. It’s normal in healthy newborns and usually clears on its own. At other ages, it may signal infection or liver disease.Swollen legs
According to Healthline, some liver diseases like cirrhosis slows the normal flow of blood through the liver, thus increasing pressure in the vein that brings blood to the liver from the intestines and spleen. This causes swelling in the legs and abdomen. The increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to accumulate in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites).
Itchy skin
Itching associated with liver disease tends to be worse in the late evening and during the night. Some people may itch in one area, such as a limb, the soles of their feet, or the palms of their hands, while others experience an all-over itch.
