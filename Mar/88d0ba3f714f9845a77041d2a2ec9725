On Thursday morning, bandits stormed Agunu Dutse, Agunu Ward of Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State and reportedly abducted about 46 people.
Mr. Dauda Mustapha, a resident of the area, said he miraculously escaped from the attack, and also added that the bandits, numbering over 100 with sophisticated weapons, stormed the community around 12.30 am.
Master Maurice Clement Tanko (Galadiman Agunu Dutse), another resident of the area, said it was a horrible experience.
He said the presence of the bandits was first noticed by the community volunteers through an unusual movement in the outskirts of the community.
According to him, the bandits operated for about 10-20 minutes and gradually withdrew as they noticed that the vigilantes were on alert.
