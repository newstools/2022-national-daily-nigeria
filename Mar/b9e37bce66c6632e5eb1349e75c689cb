The Lagos State Public Works Corporation (LSPWC) on Tuesday said it would use technology to make Lagos roads motorable all year round.
LSPWC’s General Manager, Mr Lateef Somide, said this during the inspection of a concrete road constructed by the agency along LASU-Iba Road in Alimosho Local Government Area of the state.
Somide said this in a statement by spokesman for Lagos State Public Works Corporation (LSPWC), Mr Samuel Ayetutu on Tuesday.
He said the corporation was, “massively deploying its Jet Patchers with the aim of nipping emerging pot-holes in the bud before they degenerate to major defects that may call for more resources to fix.
“If you look at Lagos roads, especially in the metropolis, majority of pot-holes and sectional failures have disappeared due to the round-the-clock approach of the corporation to maintaining the roads.
“The agency’s strategy is to ensure that any road labeled pot-hole free remains so through constant monitoring to address new cases as they come up.”
The General Manager also noted Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu was committed to keeping Lagos roads smooth.
Somide said several inner roads required attention, and that many of them had been marked for rehabilitation this year depending on available resources.
“Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu is committed to supporting the agency in all possible ways in the bid to enhance free movement of persons and goods which ultimately galvanises social and economic activities in the state,” he said.
He called for collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation, Local Governments and Local Council Development Authorities, Community Development Associations and relevant government agencies to keep Lagos roads good all year round.
