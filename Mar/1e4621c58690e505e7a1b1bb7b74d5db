According to report, former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi was in Minna, Niger State on Sunday to seek the support of PDP stalwarts for his 2023 presidential ambition.
Although Peter Obi is yet to formally declare his ambition, there is no more doubt that he is interested in the country’s top-most job as he is already making consultations ahead of his declaration.
However, there are indications that suggest that Peter Obi may not get his wish to emerge as the 2023 presidential flag bearer of the PDP.
This is because according to a Punch report, three presidential aspirants of northern extraction namely former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Bala Mohammed, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal have agreed to work together to produce a consensus candidate who would represent the north in the PDP presidential primary election
The report also said, Bukola Saraki who spoke on behalf of the two governors disclosed that they would meet with Atiku Abubakar, another presidential aspirant of northern extraction, and share their plans with him
If the north eventually achieves a consensus candidate to contest for the PDP presidential ticket, it may spell doom for Peter Obi. My pragmatic assumption is that; in the presidential primary election, while the southern voters will share their votes between Peter Obi and other presidential aspirants in the south, the northern consensus candidate will enjoy all or most of the votes from northern voters. Hence, Peter Obi won’t have a realistic chance of winning the presidential ticket of the PDP
