Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has insisted that he has “no problem” staying on, despite Roman Abramovich’s plan to sell the club.
Tuchel, speaking on Friday, stated that he “loves everything about the club”.
Russian billionaire Abramovich, who has owned Chelsea since 2003 and bankrolled the club on their way to winning 19 major trophies, announced his intention to sell on Wednesday in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The 55-year-old has already received offers for Chelsea, with Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and American investor Todd Boehly understood to be two of the parties interested.
Tuchel, who was appointed under Abramovich’s ownership in January 2021, admits the owner’s decision to sell has created “uncertainty”, but has no doubts about his own future.
Asked if he would have a problem remaining at Stamford Bridge, the head coach said: “No, the opposite of a problem staying here.

“I said many times that I love working in the Premier League, I love to be in England and feel the tradition and the love for sports in general and football in particular. It’s an amazing place to be.
“Chelsea is, for me, the perfect fit. I love to be here, I love everything about the club and hopefully it continues.
“There is uncertainty, but isn’t there always for a football manager? I’m used to it on different levels. This is quite the level, I have to be honest, but I am positive and hope things will end well.”
