The blues owner, Roman Abramovich is looking to sell the two time European champions and that could happen with immediate effect as the threat of sanction looms.
The sale of Chelsea is being run by Raine Group, a New York-based merchant bank, on behalf of Abramovich, who is keen to sell his UK-based assets before any sanctions, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, take hold.
However, there are three billionaires who are capable of buying the football club from Abramovich.
Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly is behind a consortium with Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, with the pair having worked together in business in the past.
Also anther billionaire who could buy the club is INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe. He considered buying the Blues in the past and has reportedly been linked with making an offer to buy the club yet again. Ratcliffe is worth around £20billion thanks to his multi-national chemicals company Ineos.
The richest man in Africa, Aliko Dangote is another billionaire who could buy the club. He’s had an interest in buying a football club in London in which he made an approach for Arsenal but wasn’t successful. He is currently valued at about $11.5 billion according to Forbes. According to reports, Abramovich is willing to sell the club at around £4 billion.
