Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveFormer Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has declared his intention to run for the 2023 presidency.
Mr Obi made his intentions public during a visit to Anambra Traditional rulers on Thursday.
“My job here is simple, to inform you people as my own fathers that I’ll be aspiring for the post of President of Nigeria,” Mr Obi said.
Mr Valentine Obienyem, Mr Obi’s Media Adviser, had previously disclosed to the media Mr Obi’s intent to run.
“I can assure you that Obi will soon speak as promised and when he does, Nigerians will be happy with what he will say,” Mr Obienyem said on Wednesday.
Mr Obi’s declaration comes a day after Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and his running mate in the 2019 general elections declared to run for president ahead of 2023 Presidential elections. Both Messrs Obi and Abubakar would be vying for the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.
In February,  Mr Obi announced his ambition to become Nigeria’s next president only if his party, Peoples Democratic Party, zones the presidential ticket to the South.
The South-East has not produced president for the country since the advent of the fourth republic, intensifying agitations for zoning the position to the region.
In light of his declaration, Mr Obi will be going against the likes of former Governors Orji Uzor Kalu, Rochas Okorocha and ex-Senate President Ayim Pius Ayim, who have revealed their interest to be Nigeria’s next president.
At the moment, APC national leader Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Governor Aminu Tambuwal are warming up for the 2023 race.
