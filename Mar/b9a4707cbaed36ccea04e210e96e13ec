Reactions have trailed the letter purportedly written by President Muhammadu Buhari to Dangote on Tuesday at the official opening of the Dangote Fertilizer Depot in Lagos. The picture of the letter was shared by Joe Igbokwe on his Facebook page with the caption “President Buhari wrote this today in Ibeju Lekki Lagos.

Nigerians reacted to the handwriting as follows, with many of them saying it was not written by the president but only signed by him.



If it is true that it was written by the president, then the President’s handwriting can be compared to that of a computer. And it can be ranked as one of the best. Many people might not see any politics in this, but the truth is that President Buhari has once again shown Nigerians that he is brilliant and can not be intimidated by people with higher qualifications. To say the fact, this is not an achievement but a way to prove that the President is well organized in doing his things.
