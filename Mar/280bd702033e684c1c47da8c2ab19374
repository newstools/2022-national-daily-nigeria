Nigerian radio broadcaster, Daddy Freeze, has taken to social media to call out a Nigerian man who took to social media to correct a grammatical error made by Nigerian-American singer, Davido, with regards to the high cost of clearing his Lamborghini Aventador.
Recall that Nigerian music star, Davido, had earlier on, taken to his official Twitter account to lament about the high cost of clearing his Lamborghini Aventador valued at 285 million Naira, adding that Nigerians should pray for the country.
However, following his complain, a Nigerian man, identified as Ayodeji, took to Twitter to react, as he corrected the singer for using “payed” rather than “paid” in his sentence.

Daddy Freeze further went ahead to reveal that he has made the same typographical error before, adding that Ayodeji should leave Davido’s error and help him clear his Lamborghini.
