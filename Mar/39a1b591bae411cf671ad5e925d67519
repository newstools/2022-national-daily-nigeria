Manchester United want to bring Nigerian forward Victor Osimhento Old Trafford but will not pay Napoli’s £100million asking price.


Osimhen, 23, arrived in Naples from Lille for an initial £58m, making him the second most expensive African in world football behind Arsenal’s Nicolas Pepe.


He has struck 11 goals in 22 appearances during an injury-disrupted campaign this term and is a popular figure at the Serie A club.


Interim Red Devils boss Ralf Rangnick has been asked to draw up a list of potential summer targets by CEO Richard Arnold and the Daily Star suggest Osimhen features prominently.


However, Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis has told United to forget about landing his prized asset unless they are willing to pay an eye-watering fee.


While the Premier League side will be hopeful of driving that price down in negotiations, cheaper options are now likely to be explored too.


Another Napoli player high on United’s radar is midfielder Fabian Ruiz, according to reports in Italy.


Spaniard Ruiz, 25, has improved markedly since joining from Real Betis in 2018 and is now considered one of the Partenopei’s key players.


But with his deal set to expire at the end of next season and discussions over a new contract reaching an impasse, several clubs are ready to pounce.


As well as United, Arsenal, Barcelona and Real Madrid have been linked with summer bids.
