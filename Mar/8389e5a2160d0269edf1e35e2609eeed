A delegation of German lawmakers are in Israel to learn about the country’s `Arrow 3’ missile shield as Berlin considers purchasing a defence system of its own.
The group of 10 familiarised themselves with the system, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann the head of Germany’s parliamentary defence committee confirmed after a visit to the Israeli Defence Ministry in Tel Aviv.
Strack-Zimmermann said that the Arrow 3 system is of interest “because its about defending against missiles that come from so high up that we don’t have the tools in Germany to fend off such missiles.”
Numerous meetings are scheduled for the trip, which is due to last until Thursday.
Strack-Zimmermann said the trip to Israel had been planned for a long time and they “are not on a shopping spree”.
She said the trip was about an exchange with representatives of a country “that has lived in a state of war since its existence.”
The armed conflict in Ukraine has led to calls for Germany to consider getting its own missile defence system.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz told broadcaster ARD on Sunday that Berlin is considering setting up a missile protection shield for all of Germany based on the Israeli model.
The Arrow system is capable of destroying approaching long-range ballistic missiles and works very high above the Earth, even into the stratosphere.
This would be a new capability for the Bundeswehr.
It has nothing to do with the Israeli missile defence shield dubbed “Iron Dome,” which is designed for lower-flying short-range missiles.
For defence against short-range missiles, the Bundeswehr has the Patriot system.
