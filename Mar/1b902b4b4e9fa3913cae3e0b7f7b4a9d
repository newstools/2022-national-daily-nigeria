“I have listened to our party leaders, women and youths on the call that I should initiate and begin the process of consultations with a view of running and contesting for the President of Nigeria under the banner of our great party,” he said.
“When members of the House of Representatives of the 7th Assembly approached with their desire for me to contest for the position of Speaker, I gave them certain conditions, one of which was that I have leaders –  late President Shehu Shagari, former Governor Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko and two others in (Sokoto) state.
“I told them to go to my state and consult with these leaders. If they bless your initiative, I will accept your proposal and contest for the Speaker.
The governor stressed that the direction of current political pursuits must be based on a genuine effort to produce a President for the benefit of Nigeria and Nigerians.
While calling for unity among party members ahead of the general elections, Governor Tambuwal noted that the PDP remains the hope of Nigerians.
He said the PDP is ready to take over power from the ruling All Progressives Congress.
