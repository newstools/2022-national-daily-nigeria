“David Bennett, 57, had received his transplant on January 7, 2022, and passed away March 8,” the University of Maryland Medical System said in a statement.
“His condition began deteriorating several days ago. After it became clear that he would not recover, he was given compassionate palliative care. He was able to communicate with his family during his final hours,” the statement said Wednesday.
The procedure initially raised hopes that advances in cross-species organ donation could one day solve the chronic shortage of human organs available for donation.
“He proved to be a brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end. We extend our sincerest condolences to his family,” said Bartley Griffith, the lead surgeon.
Bedridden, Bennett came to the hospital in the Eastern US state of Maryland in October 2021, and was placed on emergency life support machine.
He had been deemed ineligible for human transplant — a decision that is often taken when the recipient has very poor underlying health.
“We have gained invaluable insights learning that the genetically modified pig heart can function well within the human body while the immune system is adequately suppressed.
“We remain optimistic and plan on continuing our work in future clinical trials,” said Muhammad Mohiuddin, director of the university’s cardiac xenotransplantation programme.
