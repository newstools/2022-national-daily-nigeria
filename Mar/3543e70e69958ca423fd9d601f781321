The 2021/2022 season is gradually coming to an end and it’s getting tougher with so many fixtures to be played in a short time. Some of the top teams across Europe would be challenged to cope up with the too many fixtures because it could affect their results and even make them to possibly lose out on all.
The Chelsea Football Club, is really enjoying a fine form recently as they have received injury boosts following the return and fitness of their key players. Chelsea are in all competitions as regards to their league and even Champions League, having lost to Liverpool in the Carabo Cup final.
Currently, the EPL top four position is highly competitive as the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, the in-form Arsenal, Tottenham and even West Ham are contending for it.
Chelsea have very close fixtures just like they would play three matches within one week which would be against Norwich, Newcastle and Lille. A loss in any of two EPL games could mar their hopes of remaining in the top four position, following the competition from other teams and playing two matches before their game against Lille could lead to fatigue of the players. This could be a threat against a very fast playing team like Lille.
Though often times we’ve seen Chelsea handle even more difficult fixtures and scaled through. Do you think it would work for them this time as every team is struggling to retain their place?
