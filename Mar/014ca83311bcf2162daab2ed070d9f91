On Friday, it was reported in news that the Russian parliament has already approved a new law that allows the authorities in Russia to jail people for up to 15 years, if they are convicted for deliberately spreading fake news about the Russia’s Armed Forces and it’s operation in Ukraine.
This law is also applicable to those who refer to ongoing activities in Ukraine as invasion, attack or war, as the country is educating her students to refer to Russia’s present mission in Ukraine as a “special military operation” and not war, invasion or an attack.
However, according to a news that was published by Daily Mail yesterday, it was reported that Chelsea boss, Roman Abramovich may not be able to go back to his country again so that he won’t be jailed or he should go back after President Vladimir Putin’s administration because of how he described Russia’s military operation in Ukraine after he was banned from living in Britain. After he was banned from living in Britain, Abramovich decided to sell his club, Chelsea Football Club in order to avoid further sanctions.
While Roman Abramovich was reacting to this development in a letter, he said that he wants to sell his club and donate the money to a charitable foundation, as the proceed will be donated to the foundation in order to support the “victims of the war in Ukraine.”
The war used by Abramovich to describe the activities of Russia in Ukraine is now illegal and as thus, he might be jailed for that if he should go back to Russia.
Earlier, British government banned Roman Abramovich from living in Britain after he was suspected to have ties with President Vladimir Putin.
