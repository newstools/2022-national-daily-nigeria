The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said it has cancelled 11, 321 voters card for double or multiple registration in the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration (CVR), in Plateau State.
The electoral umpire said also, a total of 232, 265 people have commenced pre-registration, while 79, 454 people have updated and transferred their voting location and only 47, 195 have completed their registration out of which 40, 491 have been approved by the Commission in the State.
Speaking with journalists on Monday in Jos, during a press briefing and a courtesy visit paid to the Commission, by a Non-governmental Organization (NGO), known as CYPA Africa, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mal. Hussaini Pai, also informed that the CVR will officially end in June 2022.
“11, 321 applicants have been rejected because they have previously registered, multiple or more than one registration”, Pai said.
According to him: “All persons who have just turned 18 years and those who though more than 18 years but have not registered in any previous voter registration should avail themselves at their registration area collation centres: the CVR also offers opportunity to those who registered previously to collect their uncollected PVCs”, he said.
Pai said the ongoing CVR also offers the opportunity to those who wish to transfer to any of the newly converted polling units nearer to their present residences.
“Utilizing the newly converted polling units helps to avoid voters trekking long distances on election day, especially when there is restriction of vehicular movements.
“Those who wish to replace their damaged or lose Permanent Voters Card (PVC),  are advised to take advantage of the CVR now that it is closer to them”, Pai said.
