The All Progressives Congress (APC) commenced the screening of aspirants for the national chairman as seven contenders submitted their nomination forms to the sub-committee of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) for assessment. The screening is the final lap of the preparations for the APC national convention in Abuja on March 26 for the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.
The aspirants that submitted forms for screening include Senator Abdullahi Adamu, former Governor of Nasarawa State; Senator Tanko Al-Makura, former Governor of Nasarawa State; Senator George Akume, former Governor of Benue State; Senator Sani Musa from Niger State, former Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State, Mallam Salihu Mustapha, and Muhammed Etsu.
Former Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State is the only aspirant that defied the resolution of the APC to zone the party’s national chairman to north central as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did.
Some APC leaders had earlier considered the adoption of consensus candidate for the national chairman, and other NWC offices. This appears to be difficult to achieve except further and deeper consultations are held by the party leaders at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari to whom all party stakeholders have declared their allegiance.
Senator Ali Ndume from Borno State had earlier said that it is not out place for President Buhari to endorse a particular aspirant for the national chairman, adding that whoever the president endorses all other party members will comply. Ali Ndume had insisted that, personally, he supports whosoever President Buhari endorses for the national chairman.
About four aspirants are also contesting for the APC national secretary from the southwest.
