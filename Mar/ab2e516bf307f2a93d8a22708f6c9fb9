Senator Sani Musa and Abdullahi Adamu, former governor of Nasarawa State, will go into the March 26 National Convention of the All Progressives Congress as rivals jostling for the party’s National Chairmanship position which has been zoned to the north-central geopolitical zone.
While Senator Sani enjoys the support of Tinubu, several credible news sources have reported that Mr. Adamu is the preferred candidate of President Buhari for the position.
According to a Vanguard report, Bola Tinubu the National Leader of the APC, during a visit to Senator Sani, assured him (Sani) that the contribution he made to the success of the APC in 2014/2015 would not go in vain, and that he (Tinubu) along with the southwest would support Sani for the National Championship position of the party.



According to reports, President Buhari reportedly instructed some APC governors to deliver Mr. Adamu as the next national chairman of the party prior to his trip to Kenya.
With a political juggernaut like Tinubu backing Senator Sani and the president allegedly backing Mr. Adamu, it is difficult to say who would come out on top, however, this article will briefly analyze why Tinubu’s anointed candidate, Senator Sani will lose out to Abdullahi Adamu if the report that he (Adamu) is Buhari’s preferred candidate is true.
Tinubu has spent the better part of his political career in the southwest and although he has powerful allies in the north like Governor Ganduje and Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello, Buhari’s political capital in the North is far more superior to that of Tinubu
As president, Buhari has more control of APC’s leadership structure than Tinubu, the party’s National Leader. With Buhari’s superior political capital in the north and his control of the APC leadership structure, I believe his alleged anointed candidate will emerge as the next national chairman of the APC ahead of Tinubu’s preferred candidate
