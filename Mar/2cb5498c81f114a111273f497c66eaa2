A Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) bus went up in flames on Friday at Agric Bus Stop in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State.
The incident was said to have caused panic among road users as they scampered for safety.
According to Vanguard, an eyewitness said, ‘Street urchings popularly called ‘area boys’, stopped passers-bys, from putting out the fire as the excuse gathered was that they were angry because of what happened to the 22-year-old fashion designer, Ayanwole  Oluwabimise, who was found dead in Lagos after boarding a Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, bus heading to Oshodi from Chevron bus stop, Lekki.”
