Senator Shehu Sani has raised concerns over imprecise projections, or what many call prophecies of the year at the beginning of the year 2022.
The former Senator was apprehensive that certain devastating occurrences have manifested in the year that were not prophesied at the beginning of the year.
The occurrences, Sani tweeted, manifested both within and outside Nigeria, with tragic effects on humanity.  Shehu Sani on his official twitter handle @ShehuSani wrote: “ At the beginning of the year, none of the ‘Prophets’ prophesied Ukraine, national grid failure and energy crisis.” These occurrences have been big blows to humanity and happened suddenly beyond human apprehension.
