Germany will not be sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help in its defense against the Russian invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Wednesday.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pressuring the west and Europe to assist his country with air defense assets in the face of on-going Russian attacks.
Scholz said that a military solution to the war in Ukraine “makes no sense” and urged for a diplomatic solution.
Germany has provided humanitarian aid, equipment and some weapons “but otherwise we have to think very carefully about what we are doing now and that certainly does not include fighter jets,” he said standing alongside with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in Berlin.
The Pentagon has dismissed a proposal from Poland to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland’s proposal was “tenable,” .
Polish officials earlier released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force’s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.
