In the videos, a number of Russian military vehicles are seen in addition to artillery guns. CNN has been unable to geolocate the videos or verify their authenticity.
“Here the [tanks] are abandoned,” someone said in the video. “They just abandoned them here.”
In another video, a Ukrainian soldier narrated what he said happened to the artillery position.
“One of the columns was withdrawing from Mykoliav and this is what’s left of our ‘brothers,’ the ones that came to ‘save us’,” he said, sarcastically referencing Russian claims that Ukrainians need saving.
He later said the Russian Howitzers that had been shelling them will now be turned back on the Russians.
This new apparent victory by Ukrainian forces comes two days after Vitali Kim published a video showing the Ukrainian military claiming to have pushed Russian military from their positions at a heavily contested air base in southeastern Mykoliav.
