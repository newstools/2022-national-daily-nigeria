The Lagos State Government on Friday denied appointing suspended State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Musiliu Akinsanya, known as MC Oluomo, General Manager of Lagos Transport Parks, and Garages Committee.
The Chairman of the Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Transportation, Temitope Adewale, in a statement on Friday clarified the ban of NURTW members from motor parks and garages in the state, saying
There should be no need for any contention of the action of the State Government in the wake of the crisis ravaging the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW).
Temitope Adewale emphasized that the state legislature acted proactively, revealing that a law creating the Lagos State Parking Authority already exists, saying the authority would hence oversee activities at all the parks in the State.
Adewale had declared: “the House is fully aware of developments in the transportation union and now that the crisis has resulted in the banning of NURTW activities in Lagos. “… all parks, garages and parking activities would be under the Lagos State Parking Authority as stipulated by law.”
The lawmakers insisted that since the NURTW is plunged into crisis, Lagos State must take responsibility for park activities to forestall breakdown of law and order.
According to the lawmaker, “The law approves a General Manager for the Parking Authority.
“Lagosians should be calm. The situation is under control as the government takes necessary actions.”
The Lagos State Government on Thursday suspended all NURTW park activities in the State.
