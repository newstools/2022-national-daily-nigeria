After his bail application failed and a federal high court remanded him in Kuje prison, DCP Abba Kyari has been fashioning out how to cope when life throws one a curveball.
But there are couples of things he cannot help.
He has rejected the prion food, for starters. And that lies within his rights.
“Our law allows us to request any inmate who wishes to do self-feeding to apply through a formal application to the officer in-charge of the custodial centre,” said the Nigeria Correctional Service spokesman Francis Enobore told the Punch.
“Subject to the approval of the official in-charge, the applicant will make arrangements with whoever he wishes to bring food for him.”
Kyari now eats food his relatives bring for him.
While in the custody of NAFDAC that busted him for drug trafficking, Kyari had no inmate bugging him—which meant some privilege to be by himself.
Not so again at Kuje.
Sources within the facility said those Kyari sent—or helped send—there in his glory day as Nigeria’s foremost cop may end up becoming a thorn in his neck.
Chins were already wagging about the hunter now being the hunted.
