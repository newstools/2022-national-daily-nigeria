The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has eulogised three police officers for rejecting bribes and demonstrating exemplary performances in the course of their duty.
The IGP encouraged senior police officers to always celebrate officers who show similar performance in their respective jurisdictions. He said such actions make a positive impact on the goodwill and image of the Nigeria Police Force.
The IGP assured the entire police workforce of sustainable efforts in improving their condition of service with a view to making life meaningful to them and having a force of their choice.
The celebrated police officers include Sergeant Sampson Ekikere, Sergeant Yahaya Ahmed, and Elemide Bishop, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP).
The acting Force Public Relations Officer, Force headquarters, Abuja, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement highlighted that Ekikere, attached to 22 Police Mobile Force, Ikeja, Lagos, was commended for recovering a wallet belonging to one Lukman Abaja.
He traced the owner to deliver the found item to him Saturday last week.
Ahmed rejected a N300,000 bribe offered to him by one Chukwuka Jude who was arrested at the Higher Shari’ah Court in the Tudun Wada, Gusau, Zamfara State, for offences relating to false presentation and cheating by impersonation.
Bishop,  Head of Operations at the Police Radio,  was mistakenly credited with the sum of N600,000 into his police account.
“The officer withdrew the money and remitted it back to the Nigeria Police Cooperative Society treasury, showing attributes of an honest and trustworthy police officer,” Adejobi noted.
