Nollywood actor, Mike Ezuruonye has reacted to a viral video of Nigerian soldiers digging the ground in search of water to drink.
In the video, some men of the Nigerian army could be seen in the open bushes digging out water from the dry grounds with their tools. One of the men could also be seen drinking the water as others gather with their cans and buckets to fetch from the tiny well they made. A man in the background who seems to be recording the video could be heard saying; “See the way soldiers dey find water”.
From the looks of the video, it seems they’re in a deserted area and desperately in need of water to drink. Amazingly, the soldiers seem unbothered by what they’re doing as they laugh and gist among themselves while fetching from the well.
Reacting to the video, the actor shared it on Instagram as he hailed the soldiers, calling them the noblemen of the Nigerian army. He also posted it with a praying emoji in the caption, indicating that he’s praying for them.
They do say that desperate times do calls for desperate measures, though the water may be generally considered unclean and unhealthy, the soldiers who are dedicated to protecting the citizens took the risk for the sake of the country.
