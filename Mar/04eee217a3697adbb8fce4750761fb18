Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has slammed the Governor of Rivers State. Nyemsom Wike over his removal from office by the court. He accused the Rivers governor of being the force behind the legal tussle for his removal from office by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, including the dismissal of his suit for stay of execution of the sack order by the Federal High Court.
The Ebonyi governor had said that the difference between himself and Governor of Rivers State, whom, avoiding to him, he thanked for carrying out the hatchet job and likened to Judas Iscariot in the Bible, is their faith.
Umahi made the innuendo that he serves only the living God while that of Rivers might be based on alcohol.
Governor Umahi asserted that he has fewer worries after a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja ordered that he and his deputy, Eric Igwe, should vacate their seats. Umahi maintained that besides the immutable fact that he has immunity as an elected governor, votes secured during an election legally belong to the candidate and not a political party.
Meanwhile, Umahi has gone on appeal which is still pending in court.
