Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), on Wednesday arrived Kyiv to insist on greater humanitarian access and protection of civilians.
Maurer in a statement said that he would continue his regular humanitarian dialogue with government officials in Moscow as well.
“After enormous suffering by the civilian population and after our intensive virtual conversations with the Russian and Ukraine governments, I find it utterly important that we have person-to-person contacts.
“We want to be able to go in-depth into the understanding of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian work, and that our licence to operate in the country is fully understood by the authorities.
Maurer had told the media that he was “cautiously positive” that the ICRC would gain access to Ukrainian and Russian prisoners held in the context of the conflict.
