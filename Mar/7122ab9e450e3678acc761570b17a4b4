A Manager with WEMA BANK Plc, Mr. Ojo Oladipupu has been arrested for trying to bribe ASP Jonathan Egwemi, a Policeman attached to Area G Command, Ogba, Lagos State, in order to prevent him from investigating the WEMA Bank in an alleged money laundering deal worth over N1.7Bn.
Aside from arresting Mr. Oladipupo, he was equally charged before the Ogba Magistrates Court for the alleged money inducement to a Police officer.
The Police alleged the bank manager to have come to Area G Command and offered the officer, ASP Jonathan Egwumi, the money so as to scuttle investigations over shady deals involving WEMA Bank and the Director of Shibahwell Energy Limited, Adewole Isaac, to the tune of over N1.7b suspected to be proceeds of illegal activities.
However, when the manager, Oladipupo, who may have thought that he would have his way, offered the money, he was immediately arrested and detained at the Command for his conduct and later charged before the Court.

Layinka, granted him bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum and the matter was adjourned till 11th April, 2022, for mention when the matter may likely be joined with the sister matter before the Court, which warranted offering bribe to the Police officer.
