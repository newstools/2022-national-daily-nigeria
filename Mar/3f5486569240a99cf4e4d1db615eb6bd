The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, says the Nigerian Army will continue to meet the security expectations of all Nigerians.
Yahaya said this at the opening of a three-day Senior Command and Leadership Seminar organised by Department of Army Training on Tuesday at the Headquarters 3 Division Nigerian Army, Jos.
In a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Tuesday, the COAS pledged army’s commitment to providing safe and secure environment for socio-economic development of the nation.
He said the efforts of troops across theatres of operations had continued to yield tremendous results, adding that conflicts had transcended beyond the traditional warfare to cyber and media warfare.
According to him, there is the need to invest efforts in instilling senior leadership of the army with necessary skills to manage the complexities of the non-kinetic dimension of operations.
He urged commanders to actively engage other stakeholders in the society and strengthen synergy with sister services and security agencies to achieve the common goal of securing the country.
Yahaya expressed appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for his untiring support and strategic guidance to the Nigerian army in the efforts to execute its constitutional roles.
The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 3 Division, Maj.-Gen. Ibrahim Ali, said the seminar would afford participants the opportunity to build on their individual capacities and contribute meaningfully towards the enhancement of army operations.
The Chief of Training (Army), Maj.-Gen. Abdulsalam Ibrahim, said the non-kinetic line of operations was essential in tackling contemporary security challenges.
He added that the operations were currently being reviewed to provide the Nigerian army with the needed impetus to meet its constitutional mandate.
