Former Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso is at the verge of dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), in search of ticket for the 2023 presidential election.
Kwankwaso had consulted with the NNPP leadership in Abuja to tidy up his exit from the PDP to the NNPP.
The National Secretary of NNPP Special National Executive Committee (NEC), Ambassador Agbo Gilbert, disclosed the planned defection of Kwankwaso to the NNPP. He said that the defection would be made public in the next few days.
