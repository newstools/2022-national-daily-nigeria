According to Sanusi: “Today, you see civil servants stealing millions and billions of naira meant to build roads, provide power, water, education, food and transportation, to the detriment of the majority of Nigerians.
“All of these have given birth to Boko Haram, killer herdsmen, bandits and numerous arms struggles, especially among the youths, which resulted in the worst threats to human lives all over Nigeria.”
The level of insecurity in Nigeria continues to rise, with the activities of Boko Haram and banditry in the North.
