The South-West region of Nigeria has been gaining unlimited attention and making headlines ever since the early days of the year, as many believe that the region has a strong chance of producing the next president.

In the region, the former governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu, is currently the talk of the nation as he has been consulting around the country ever since he declared his intention of running for the presidency, while the current vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, is also believed by many people to be eyeing the presidency and intending to declare his intention soon.
However, the new game of APC cabals seems to be different from these as they seem to be working in favour of the South South region to succeed Buhari instead of the South West.
Firstly, there were speculations that some groups are working tirelessly to make sure that the present CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele enter the race, as they wanted to use him as their consensus candidate against Tinubu and others.
Aside from that, the way the presidency and some members are pushing for the former River State governor, Rotimi Amaechi, is concerning, as many people believed he would be President Buhari’s choice.
Apart from the chieftain he got in Daura some weeks ago that caused many reactions across the country, President Muhammadu Buhari also invited him to dinner along with many politicians that have declared their intention to run for the presidency despite the fact that he has not declared his interest in running, which seems to make what people are saying about being Buhari’s choice to be legit.

Apart from that, some Northern APC cabals and members who seem not to see Amaechi and Emefiele as giant politicians enough to defeat PDP have sent a message to another South-South politician, Ebele Jonathan, in the APC presidential race, as these people believe that there is something tangible for him in the party.
