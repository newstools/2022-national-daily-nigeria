Spurs manager Antonio Conte has had his say on the competitive nature of the English premier league, as his team battles to secure a champions league spot ahead of next season.

The North London club are beginning to find their rhythm after what was a very slow start to life under Antonio Conte.
Spurs defeated London rivals West Ham in a crucial derby by a 3-1 scoreline, with Son Heung-min grabbing a brace in the encounter.
The win moves Conte’s team to 5th position on the log, three points behind 4th placed Arsenal, as they continue to fight for a top four finish.
Speaking on his club’s struggle to dominate in the league this season, Antonio Conte went on to admit that Spurs are still behind the big teams and went on to name four club’s who are far above the rest in the league.


In his words, he said “There are four teams that in my opinion in England are better than the others. I am talking about Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool”.
At the moment City, Chelsea and Liverpool currently occupy the top three spot on the log, while United are 6th, battling it out with Spurs for a top 4 spot.
