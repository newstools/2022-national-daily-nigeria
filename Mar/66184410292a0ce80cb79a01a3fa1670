North Korea on Wednesday fired another missile into the sea of the coast of Japan. South Korea had raised alarm that “unknown projectile” was launched by the North Wednesday morning but said that the missile appeared to fail immediately.
It was indicated that the missile was fired from an airfield outside Pyongyang. Several missile tests, including tests the US alleged were intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), were said to be fired from the missile site.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff in a statement, declared: “North Korea fired an unknown projectile from the Sunan area around 09.30 today, but it is presumed that it failed immediately after launch.”
An expert witness was said to have narrated “loud “blowing” sounds, similar to that of a large aircraft, were audible in Pyongyang, followed by a loud “crash”; had seen an image showing a red-tinted ball of smoke in the sky above the capital.”
Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Ankit Panda was cited to have explained that the image was consistent with that of a “catastrophic failure”. The Fellow maintained that “reddish-orange smoke” is associated with liquid fuel – something that is “very toxic” to humans.
North Korea has tested nine missiles since the beginning of this year.
The U.S. had observed that the North missile tests are parts of a new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and that the North may have been experimental launches before a probable full-range ICBM launch.
It was highlighted that a minimum range of 5,500km (3,417 miles), ICBMs can reach the U.S.
