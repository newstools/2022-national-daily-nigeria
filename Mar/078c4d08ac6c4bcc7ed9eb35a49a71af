His flights were monitored and recorded following the seizure of his club, and further plans by the EU to pile on the sanctions.
The 55-year-old first flew in his private jet to Tel Aviv, Israel, where he was sighted, before he made for Turkey, and then Moscow.
The Israeli government already warned the billionaire cronies of Russian President Vladimir Putin they can’t hide in the country.
Abramovich landed in Moscow at around 3am UK time on Monday.
His £49m Gulfstream can’t be imobilized like the yachts of other Russian oligarchs marooned around Europe.
The west and Europe are hammering Putin’s men for their silence in the face of his invasion of Ukraine.
The billionaire promised earlier the profit from the sale of his club will be donated to Ukraine. That gesture seems not enough.
