UK Prme Minister, Borris Johnson, has revealed why Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich is yet to be sanctioned amid his alleged link to Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
According to Johnson, one of the reasons is that the UK government must first ensure a due process before sanctioning Roman Abramovich, who had repeatedly denied links with Putin.

Johnson also recalled of the growing calls for Abramovich who had owned Chelsea since 2003, to be vindicated from the economic measures being taken against Russians who are said to have ties to Putin following the invasion of Ukraine.

During a briefing with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, on Friday, Johnson had given another opinion on why Abramovich is yet to be sanctioned, stating that no citizen would dare to reside in a country where the state can freeze his assets without a very high burden of proof and due process.
“There’s no point saying yeah, we are going to go after him, and then you come up against the brick wall of lawyers.”
“So we have to get it right this time”
