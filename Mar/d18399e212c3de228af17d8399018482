The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will be deepening consultation and negotiation on the controversy of zoning in the party when the party’s National Caucus and National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday into Tuesday. It was learnt that the party may be deliberating and deciding on the 2023 presidential ticket.
It was gathered that the PDP leadership in a memo to its national caucus, requested the caucus to determine whether geopolitical zoning will strengthen the PDP to win the 2023 presidential election. The memo also requested the national caucus to evaluate the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.
The PDP is at crossroad over agitation of zoning the 2023 presidential ticket to the south for justice and equity. Several PDP stakeholders from the north had also argued that the internal power equation does not support zoning the presidential ticket to the south in 2023, citing southern presidents occupying presidential office for 13 years and north 3 years of PDP 16 years in power 1999 to 2015.
Again, the need to win the 2023 presidential election, many other stakeholders believe, does not justify zoning in the party at the moment. The party, they said, should present the best candidate in the party.
The meeting on Monday will continue the consultations among PDP elders and stakeholders at the meeting.
