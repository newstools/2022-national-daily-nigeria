The driver of the BRT vehicle that late Bamise Ayanwole boarded has claimed that he was threatened with weapons to do the bidding of his assailants.
The driver, who the police identified as Andrew Nice said, “When those guys showed me the weapons, I was filled with fear. Whatever they told me to do was what I did.
“When I followed the Carter Bridge, they ordered me to stop and open the door. When I opened the door, they started dragging her as they came down.”
The Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho shared the video, even as police had said they were not revealing the photo of the driver.
