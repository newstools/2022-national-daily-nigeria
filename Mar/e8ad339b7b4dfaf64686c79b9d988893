Over 20 legal practitioners have volunteered to provide defence for DCP Abba Kyari in his prosecution by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) on drug trafficking charges.
One of the legal practitioners, Musa Shafiu, representing Abba Kyari, disclosed that the lawyers volunteered to defend Abba Kyari because of the sacrifices he has made in tackling insecurity in the country.
NDLEA had arraigned Kyari and six others, including four suspended officers of IRT, on eight-count charge of drug related offence last Monday.
Kyari however, denied his involvement in the charges preferred against him.
The four members of the IRT were identified as ACP Sunday Ubia, ASP Bawa James, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu.
The other two persons facing prosecution include Chibunna Umeibe and Emeka Ezenwanne, who were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu.
They all pleaded not guilty to the charges.
