In the wake of rumours that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is considering running for president, controversial journalist Kemi Olunloyo has spoken out against the vice president’s going into politics. Kemi Olunloyo wrote on her official Twitter account:
A viral storey recently claimed that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has informed President Buhari of his intention to succeed him when his term expires in 2023.
Despite the fact that the politician, who is also a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has yet to officially declare his candidacy for the presidency in 2023, a slew of support groups have cropped up to cheer him on.

The contest for Buhari’s successor in 2023 is still ongoing, with interested politicians making public declarations. What are your thoughts on Kemi Olunloyo’s remarks?
