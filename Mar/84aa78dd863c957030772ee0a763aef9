He said this against the backdrop of calls for the establishment of political support groups by other religious groups as done by the Redeemed Christian Church of God.
The RCCG had earlier this month announced the establishment of a Politics and Governance Directorate to support members who want to vie for political positions.
The senator on his Twitter handle warned against such move in the north.
He said, “Once religious groups in the North begin to set up political departments, it’s not just going to be ‘a department’ like in the RCCG, it’s going to be a breeding unit for fanatical religiously crafted political ideas in pursuit of a theocratic state.
“Abeg, let the sleeping lion lie.”
