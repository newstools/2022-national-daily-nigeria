Deputy Governor Kingsley Burutu Otuaro of Delta State, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the state, has enjoined residents of the state to strive for love and peace in their daily lives.
The deputy governor noted that he is unaware of any stronger balm that heals more than love, advocating resistance to ethnic hatred and inter-ethnic hostilities.
Deputy Governor Otuaro in a tweet highlighted: “In my over two decades career of peace building and working with traditional rulers, I am still unaware of a greater healing balm than love.
‘It starves the vultures that seek and feeds on the dissenting voices of hatred and ethnic sentiments. Love alone can beautify life.
“There are six evils God truly hates and a seventh that is an abomination to him — …stirring up strife between friends/neighbour.” (Proverbs 6:16-19 KJV).
“Pursue peace and love for they are the only foundation wherein sustainable development thrives.”
