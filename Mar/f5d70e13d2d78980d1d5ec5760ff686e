Members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the North Central Zone have declared a seeming political blockade of the zone for Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, making their support public for his 2023 presidential ambition.
The zonal APC stakeholders insisted that ‘nothing will make them change their mind from supporting Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.
The stakeholders insisted that Bello’s  presidential ambition is not negotiable even when the north central produces APC National Chairman at the national convention in March.
APC stakeholders in the North Central Zone on Saturday repudiated a statement by a group, “Stakeholders in Nasarawa State Council of the All Progressives Congress,” urging Governor Bello to sacrifice his presidential ambition for the national chairmanship position allocated to the north central.
The Director-General of the North Central Coalition for Leadership, Williams Oluwatoyin, in a statement noted that the purported appeal to Governor Bello to give up his presidential ambition “stands logic on its head and also belittles the zone.” The group argued that the president is a higher stake, telling the Nasarawa APC stakeholders to aim higher.
