Embattled Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has not been sanctioned by the US, because of a request from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky.
Zelensky asked US president, Joe Biden, to avoid sanctioning Abramovich, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The 55-year-old has already been sanctioned by the UK government and EU due to his links with Russia president Vladimir Putin.
It is believed America had drafted a set of sanctions for Abramovich ,but a phone call between Zelensky and Biden has put a halt to those plans.
Zelensky reportedly asked Biden to hold off, as Abramovich could be used as a “go-between” during peace talks with Russia.
An American investment bank, the Raine Group, have been tasked with closing a deal to sell Chelsea.
The two frontrunners to buy Chelsea are the Todd Boehly consortium and Sir Martin Broughton’s consortium.
