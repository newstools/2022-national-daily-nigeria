President Joe Biden of the United States (U.S.) has made a subtle call for the elimination of President Vladimir Putin of Russia over the special military operations in Ukraine.
Biden, visiting Poland on Saturday, berated Putin on the war in Ukraine that has lasted one month, calling the Russian President “a butcher” who “cannot remain in power”.
Biden in a speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw after meeting top Ukrainian ministers in Poland, and consulting with NATO and EU allies on the Ukraine crisis, threatened the Russian President: “Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.”
However, White House urgently clarified Biden’s harsh words on Putin, explaining that the American President was not calling for “regime change” in Russia.
An official had expressed concerns that uncoordinated personal attacks are “narrowing down the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia.
Biden also attempted to water down his harsh words on Putin by appealing to Russian citizens, assuring them, they are “not our enemy”. He instigated Russians to blame their president for the heavy sanctions imposed by the West.
Biden assured Ukrainians of U.S. support, saying: “We stand with you”.
Biden expressed concerns that Russia may not change its objectives, which he said, so far, had resulted in “strategic failure”.
However, Russian forces have been pounding Ukraine with missiles despite the massive military support from the U.S., NATO and E.U. countries. Putin had cautioned the West of a nuclear war on the event of any external interference in the Ukraine crisis.
