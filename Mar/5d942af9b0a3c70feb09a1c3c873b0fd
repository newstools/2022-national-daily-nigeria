Roman Abramovich has put the club up for sale for £4 billion, according to the UK Telegraph.
His decision came up amidst pressure on the UK authorities freeze Abramovich’s assets—just like the West have descended on Russia, its oligarchs, and big businesses around the world.
The 55-year-old owned the club in 2003, for 140 million euros, and rejected offers to sell it, for 2 billion euros before now.
On Tuesday evening, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss claimed that he, along with three others, has received a proposal to buy the club.
