Following constant robberies, residents of Osasogie, Holy Rosary and Federal Government Girls College Road areas of Benin have appealed to Edo government to provide security patrol teams in the areas.
A recent robbery in one of the area led to the death of a 600 level Pharmacy student of the University of Benin who was reportedly shot by robbers in her hostel.

The student was attacked on Thursday, March 3 at her residence in Osasogie and had been on life support until her demise on Saturday, March 5.
Some of the residents who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Benin said that the area had been experiencing heightened robbery attacks in recent times.
Josephine Okoro, a resident of the area, said the deceased student was seeing off a visitor when she saw the robbers and took to her heels.
“Unfortunately, she was shot several times by the robbers at close range.
“We need security in this area. We are victims of robbery cases on daily basis,’’ she said.
Dandy Tochuwku, another student called on ASUU to call off its one-month warning strike which began on Feb. 14 as, according to him, a lot had gone wrong since the strike began.
Only on Monday, armed robbers hit at Holy Rosary area of Benin sending residents scampering to safety.
Precious Idara, a victim of the attack said that robbers broke into her house through the window, pointed a gun at her and ordered her to open the door.
According to her, they robbed three apartments, took away five cell phones, laptops and other valuables.
“I am happy because am alive and I was not hurt in anyway,’’ she said.
