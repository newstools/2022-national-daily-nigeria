Musa, who lives at Abinsi village in Guma Local Government Area of Benue, was charged with act of gross indecency and rape.
However, the Magistrate, Mr Vincent Kor, did not take the plea of the defendant for want of jurisdiction.
Kor adjourned the matter until April 11 for further mention.
Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Jonah Uletu, told the court that the case was received at the state CID, Makurdi, from the Divisional Police Headquarters, Guma, on March 3.
Uletu said that the father of the victim, Mr Ayima Dantala, had reported the case at the Abinsi Police Outpost on Feb. 27.
The prosecutor said that the victim’s father observed that his little daughter was always looking so weak and sick, and decided to take her to a clinic where she was confirmed pregnant.
He said that upon inquiry, the girl told her father that one man named Idris Musa called her into his room two times and had sexual intercourse with her without her consent.
Uletu told the court that Musa was arrested and during police investigation he confessed to committing the offence.
According to the prosecutor, the offences contravene Sections 266 and 284 of the Penal Code Laws of Benue, 2004.
