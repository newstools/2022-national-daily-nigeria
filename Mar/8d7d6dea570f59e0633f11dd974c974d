Actress, Rita Dominic, has a question for Twitter trolls, who take over the comment section of tweeps complaining about the inadequacies of Nigeria.
The actress wondered if that’s the new strategy for winning elections in the country.
She tweeted “What’s happening? Someone complains about electricity or water or education, similar looking accounts will rush to the tweet to insult them. Is that the new strategy to win election?”
