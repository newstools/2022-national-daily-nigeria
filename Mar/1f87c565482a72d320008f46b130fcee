A gang of gunmen in Ibadan shot dead a daughter, Fatimah, of Aminat Abiodun, a former Iyalode of Ibadanland. The gunmen invaded the residence of the deceased at Basorun, Bodija, Ibadan, Oyo State, where they shot the Fatimah. She was said to have been shot several times before she died.
The gunmen are yet to be identified.
It was highlighted that the mother of Fatima, Chief Abiodun Aminat, was the Iyalode of Ibadanland in August 2007 after the death of Wuraola Akintola, who died at age of 93 in 2018.
