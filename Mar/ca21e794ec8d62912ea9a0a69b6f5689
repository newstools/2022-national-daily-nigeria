A viral video showing a Nigerian police ffcier crry a food tray for a female VIP at an event in Ilorin has stirred up the old controversy about well-heeled Nigerians abusing police orderlies.
And the Force headquarters has summoned that particular officer to Abuja, and warned others attached to VIPs to stop fetching and carrying.
The police authorities in Abuja also said it was probing the viral video showing a policeman carrying the food tray of a VIP at an event in Kwara State.
“He (the policeman) has been identified. He is coming to Abuja to meet us. We’ll ask question from him and take necessary action,” said Muyiwa Adejobi, acting PPRO, in a report by the Punch.
Many past IGPs frowned at the development, and took similar tough stands against it.
But he trend has not abated.
