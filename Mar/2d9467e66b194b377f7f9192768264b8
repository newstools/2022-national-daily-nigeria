Maimuna Ibrahim, who was shot in the thigh, said she was coming back to Kaduna from a workshop in Abuja and decided to board the Abuja-Kaduna train that was attacked by terrorists on Tuesday.
Narrating her ordeal with the terrorists that attacked the train, Maimuna said they saw helI, but prayed and prayed and prayed, before the arrival of the military who chased away the terrorists and helped the victims of the attacks.
According to Maimuna, she was shot by the terrorists in her thigh and was unable to walk. But to her surprise, a soldier carried her on his back up the cliff without getting tired and conveyed her and the other victims to the hospital.
However, the major contention in Maimuna’s story is that the terrorists that attacked them are young people between the age of 18 and 20. The terrorists according to her were on Turban, a headgear that is typically worn by people living in the desert. She even confirmed that they don’t look like Nigerians and were shouting ‘Allahu akbar, Allahu Akbar as they shot sporadically.
