Nigeria’s Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, has stated that streetlights will not be installed on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Fashola explained his reasons during his recent interview with Seun Okinbaloye on Channels TV.


You may recall that the Federal government recently announced that the Lagos-Ibadan expressway is near completion. However, safety concerns have risen amid the news.
Addressing the issue, Fashola said, “It is not standard global practice to install street lights on interstate highways. The best practice is to install such on the last few kilometers that connect the highway to any major city. The ingress into Lagos and the exit part of Lagos state will get lit up with streetlights. The same will get done in Ogun State. You can verify all I have said, as you do not light up a 560km road or a 127km highway anywhere in the world. I have never seen such, and I will like to see it.”
