Ahead of the Forthcoming National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), its no longer a news that the party recently zoned the Chairmanship Position to the North-Central Geo-political Zone. Senator Abdullahi Adamu, a Former Governor of Nasarawa State and Incumbent Lawmaker representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District at the National Assembly is One of the Top Contenders in the Race to replace the current occupant of the Position, Mai Mala Buni. 

There are credible reports that President Muhammadu Buhari and a Group of APC Governors led by Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State have thrown their weights behind Adamu. Below is a list of Three Factors That Could Work Against Adamu Despite The Support of President Buhari and Some APC Governors.
1. His Age 
Currently, Adamu is the Oldest Aspirant among those jostling for the position. The Former Governor turned Senator is currently 75years-old. Thus, He might be considered too old for the Top Position.

2. His Alleged N15bn Corruption Scandal 
In 2010, Three years after he left office as Governor of Nasarawa State, Adamu was arraigned by the EFCC for allegedly embezzling the Sum of #15billion. He was indicted alongside Eighteen others including Former Nasarawa State Officials and Contractors. This Alleged misappropriation of public funds could affect his National Chairmanship Aspirant.
3. He Might Be Seen As a PDP Mole in the Party 
Adamu spent the highest number of years in his Political Career as a PDP Chieftain, he Decamped to the PDP in 2014 alongside 36 other Senators. Unlike Senator Tanko Al-makura who is founding Member of the party and a long-time loyalist of President Muhammadu Buhari, Adamu might be perceived as a PDP mole in the party. Therefore, if he emerges, the nPDP Bloc could hijack the party
