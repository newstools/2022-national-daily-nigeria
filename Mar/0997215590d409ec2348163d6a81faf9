A 2019 governorship candidate in Kogi State on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with over 50,000 supporters in Ihema, Okehi Local Government Area, Kogi State.
The PDP National Chairman, Iyocha Ayu, receiving the defectors said that the PDP will return Nigeria to its glorious days of socio-economic prosperity after the 2023 general elections, decrying the socio-economic retrogression experienced in the seven years going to the eight year of the APC government in Nigeria.
The PDP National Chairman, Iyocha Ayu, represented by the National Secretary, Sam Anyanwu, welcomed Natasha and her supporters to the PDP. He enjoined Nigerians to use the current economic situation of the country as yardstick to vote the APC out of government in 2023.
PDP State chairman in Kogi, Sam Ohutu, in conjunction with other party stakeholders in Kogi celebrated the joining of the PDP by Natasha and her supporters as open window for a massive boost of the party’s fortunes in Kogi State.
Natasha revealed her intent to contest for the PDP ticket in Kogi Central Senatorial District for the National Assembly election. She cautioned that those who intimidated her in the last election should have a rethink, declaring that she is on a fearless mission this time.
