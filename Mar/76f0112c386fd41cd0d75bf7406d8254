“Election is coming. Our party’s convention is near. I need our party’s presidential ticket. I can’t achieve it by sitting at home. I believe, jointly, we can do it. I hope you can back me successfully for the aspiration of my lifetime ambition.
“Going by the counsel of the wise that says, ‘If you want to go fast, do it alone. If you want to go faster, go together.’ I’m asking for that team support to get me nominated by the party and eventually elected as the President of Nigeria. I urge you to look at my capacity and experience.”
