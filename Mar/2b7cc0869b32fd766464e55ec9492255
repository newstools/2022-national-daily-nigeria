Dmytro Zhyvytskyy posted photographs of the charred shell of a four-story building and rescuers searching rubble.
In a later Facebook post, he said many Russian soldiers and some local residents also were killed during the fighting on Sunday.
Russian forces encircled Kyiv on Monday in an effort to move on the most important city in Ukraine.
