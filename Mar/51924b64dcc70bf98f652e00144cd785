Mr Emmanuel Ariyo, the proprietor of Best Legacy Nursery and Primary School, Ilorin, has called on both the Federal and state governments to establish more technical schools in the country to accelerate employment.
Ariyo said on Friday in Ilorin that such would help to empower youths after graduation and make them self- dependent.
“Government should try to establish more technical schools in each state across the country. Young and old people will benefit from such schools.
“Technical schools will help reduce the rates of unemployment and poverty.
“Nigerian leaders must start prioritising the establishment of technical schools.
“Also, government must engage in the training and recruitment of experts in technical education that will train students that will be admitted into such schools, “he said.
He appealed to parents to stop underrating technical schools.
He advised them to enroll their children there for them to acquire skills and knowledge that would turn them to employers of labour in years to come.
He also called on individuals and NGOs to invest in the establishment of more technical schools for a better Nigeria.
