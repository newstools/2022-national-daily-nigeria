The Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, a former Deputy Governor of Abia State, has declared interest to contest the governorship election in Abia State in the 2023 general elections. Abaribe, speaking on ARISE New Television monitored from Lagos by National Daily noted his previous attempts to be Abia governor which were unsuccessful, expressing optimism that the right time for him to be the Governor of Abia State is now.
Abaribe noted that he has the integrity, the capacity and pedigree to be Abia governor in the 21st century.
The senator who has developed high reputation for standing up for the poor stated that he has been in service of the oppressed across the country and has done much for the people of Abia State.
National Daily inquiry show that Abaribe has, indeed, been a senator for all Nigerians. At different times, he was a lone voice in the National Assembly opposing particular policy against the Nigerian people, kicking against government policies that will increase the hardship on citizens.
The senator also stood firm on issues concerning the southeast. At the most critical time, Abaribe was the only Igbo political actor that had the confidence to stand for bail of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) when his trial commenced in Abuja. Abaribe also paid highly demeaning cost of going to prison when the court said Kanu jumped bail and was not available for further prosecution. The senator regained freedom after serial legal battle and protests.
Abaribe, accordingly, asserted that he has the pedigree, considering his antecedents, to be Governor of Abia State, adding that he understands the problems the people are facing and has the capability to provide good governance and rapid development in the state.
