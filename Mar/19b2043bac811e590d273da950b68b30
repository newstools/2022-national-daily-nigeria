It is no longer news that the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Buni, has been allegedly removed from being the Caretaker Chairman of APC after he was accused of being uninterested in letting the convention meeting of the party be held on March 26.
The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has taken over, which seems not to go down well with many in the APC, and it is gradually turning into a major crisis in the party.
Things seem to be going better for APC, but ever since Buni was reportedly removed, there have been many confusion, division, argument and other crisis in the party that may force many politicians to defect from the party, which might affect APC’s chances in 2023 if care is not taken.

Firstly, no less than 13 governors have ganged up against their fellow governors in the party as they believe that they have hands in the sudden removal of Mai Buni. These 13 governors claimed that their fellow governors were belittling them in decision-making, which they would never take.
Apart from that, the removal of Buni may cause him and his associates to defect from the party to others that may treat them better, as many people believe that Buni was removed in an unconstitutional way.
Not only that, 13 governors who don’t like how decisions are being made in the APC also claimed to be ready to battle their fellow governors or leave the party for them if nothing changes or they don’t give adequate respect to them in the party.
However, the national secretary of APC, Mr. Akpanudoedehe, stormed out of committee meeting and there is another rumour that he have resign over the sudden removal of Buni, before he later denounces the rumour as fake.
