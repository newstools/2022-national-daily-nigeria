Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveFrench President Emmanuel Macron has warned the west of escalating the Ukrainian war following US President Joe Biden calling his Russian counterpart a ‘butcher’ in Poland on Saturday.
“I wouldn’t use terms like because I’m still in talks with President Putin,” Macron said during an interview on French Channel France 3.
Biden, according to CNN, is taking things personally, owing to a decade-long rivalry between him and President Vladimir Putin.
The American president has called putting a ‘war   criminal’, “murderous dictator, and ‘a pure thug’.
But Macron said, “Our goal is to stop the war Russia launched in Ukraine, while avoiding a war and escalation.”
