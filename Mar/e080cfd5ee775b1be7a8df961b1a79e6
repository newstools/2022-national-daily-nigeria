Surgeon Timur Marin who confirmed it told Ukrainian television from the city.
“While she was being resuscitated and the anti-shock measures were being taken, we performed a caesarean section and took a child with no signs of life. The child’s resuscitation for more than half an hour did not work. Resuscitation of the mother for half an hour or more — without any results. They both died.”
Three other people died in the attack Wednesday, which came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate.
The Mariupol city council accused Russian forces of dropping several bombs on it from the air, calling the destruction “enormous.”
