On Saturday, the former Super Eagles players met with Tinubu at his home, ahead of the novelty football match scheduled for Sunday at Onikan Stadium in Lagos State.
Omoyele Sowore, a presidential aspirant, under the platform of the African Action Congress, AAC, has berated former Super Eagles players for paying a visit to a former Lagos State Governor and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
Sowore, in a post on his verified social media accounts, described the senior players’ visit to Tinubu, who is pursuing the APC’s presidential ticket, as one “driven by hunger.”



Kanu Nwankwo, Jay-Jay Okocha, Taribo West, and Victor Ikpeba were among the ex-internationals who visited Tinubu’s home.
The ex-Super Eagles players will take part in a novelty match to mark Tinubu’s 70th birthday.
The novelty match is expected to feature 17 former Nigerian internationals.
Sowore said, “Hunger is a bastard! JJ Okocha, Kanu Nwankwo, Victor Ikpeba, Taribo West, and other ex-Super Eagles players paid Tinubu a visit today to endorse him.
“I used to think Victor Ikpeba was a smart person! Shame on these ex-soccer Super Eagles players! Imagine sending them to play for Nigeria as a team in the World Cup after they’ve expired?”
