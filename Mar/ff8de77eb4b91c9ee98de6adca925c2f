Ukraine has reiterated its demand for the supply of offensive weapons by Western leaders to empower Ukrainian forces with advanced weapons to confront Russian forces that are slowly approaching Kyiv.
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly called on European countries and the United States to supply the Ukrainian forces weapons to prosecute the war against Russia.
Presidential advisory in Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, at a panel discussion Tuesday night declared: “Our armed forces and citizens are holding out with superhuman courage, but we cannot win a war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence.
“In our case, deterrence, not aggression.”
Yermak maintained that it is “impossible” for Ukraine to effectively defend itself without a reliable “air defence system that shoots down the enemy and ballistic missiles from a great distance.”
Russia had announced the deployment of hypersonic missiles to the battle territory near Romania, a border territory between Ukraine and NATO member.
U.S. President Joe Biden, the NATO bloc, and some European countries have been providing military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-tank weapons.
