The governors of the ruling  All Progressives Congress (APC) may be tightening up on for national chairman of the Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mala Buni of Yobe State, who was ousted from the party leadership on Monday by Governor Abubakar Sanu Bello of Niger State. The APC governors insisting that Buni will never come back as national chairman, dissolved all the sub=committees set up by Buni, appointed new one sub-committees for the national convention on March 26. The APC subsequently scheduled an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) to hold on Thursday, March 17.
Paramount to the meeting may be issues relating to the partial dissolution of the CECPC which most members, particularly, those loyal to Governor Buni, have been tacitly eliminated from the committee.
The notice of the NEC emergency meeting, holding virtually  at 11.00am, was signed by representatives of the various sub-committees,  unlike previous statements signed by the CECPC national secretary.
According to the statement: “The CECPC of the party at its 23rd meeting of 8th March 2022, hereby calls for the meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), to consider matters pertaining to the national convention, governance of the party and any other relevant business of the party.
“All members of the NEC are by this invitation to take notice of the meeting in accordance with article 12.3.”
The APC Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee also released new list on the zoning for the National Convention.
