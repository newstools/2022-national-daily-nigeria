Air Peace Chairman, Allen Onyema, warned that airlines in the country would shut down operations over the non-availability of aviation fuel to run their operations.
‘We have only three more days, all airlines in Nigeria will shut down. We are not threatening this country; it is a fact”, Onyema said.
The Air Peace boss made this known while speaking at a meeting of oil marketers and airline operators at the National Assembly.
”I have the mandate of all airlines to demand that airlines begin importation of fuel, if we can buy planes of millions of dollars, we can also import fuel ourselves. Let NNPC give Airlines licenses, we want to import ourselves, Onyema insisted.
NNPC CEO, Mele Kyari and other stakeholders were at the meeting.
Flights and other aviation activities have been stalling since the problem started in Nigeria for weeks.
