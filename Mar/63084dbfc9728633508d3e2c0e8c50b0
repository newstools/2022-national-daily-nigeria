Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has claimed that some people cried when it dawned on them that former Anambra governor, Willie Obiano’s tenure had ended.
In a lengthy post on his Instagram page, Edochie described the embattled former governor as a “good man who did his best for Anambra.”
He said, “People were crying at the inauguration when it dawned on them that Chief Willie Obiano was leaving office. Such things only happen when good men are leaving office and I can boldly tell you that Chief Willie Obiano is a good man.”
Edochie was a Senior Special Assistant to Obiano.
Obiano has been with the anti-graft agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission since his tenure expired on Thursday.
