Federal Character Commission (FCC) says it is not embarking on staff recruitment, as being reported in a section of social media.
Chairman of FCC, Dr Muheeba Dankaka, stated this in a statement issued by the commission’s Director of Public Affairs and Communications, Dr Chuks Okoli, on Thursday in Abuja.
Dankaka disclaimed the reports of the purported ongoing recruitment at the commission, using his Facebook account.
“The commission has noted, with dismay, a circulating fake facebook account, purported to belong to the Executive Chairman of FCC, Dr Muheeba Dankaka.
“The operators of the fake facebook account claimed that staff recruitment is ongoing at FCC,” he said.
Dankaka called on the general public to note that he had no facebook account and that no staff recruitment was ongoing at the commission.
“Please be guided and have nothing to do with the fraudsters,” she said.
