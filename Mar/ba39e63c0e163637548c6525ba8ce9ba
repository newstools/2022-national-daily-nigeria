Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancerous tumors women often suffer from. It is common and also one of the most deadly forms or types of cancer in women because if it’s detected or diagnosed late, the survival rate is usually very low and disappointing.
So there’s need for every woman to know the subtle signs of breast cancer and also when best to see a doctor to avoid getting to the hospital when the issue has already escalated and perhaps become very difficult to manage. In this article in line with a publication on CDC, we are going to have a look at some of the early signs of breast cancer that should not be taken for granted.
What Are The Early Signs of Breast Cancer That Should Not Be Ignored?
1. Lump in the breast that appears to be firm and painless. This is one of the most disturbing and scary signs that should not be taken for granted. Reason being that most cancers start with abnormal growth of cells which can lead to thickening that feels like hardened swellings in the breast. So if you notice hard swellings in your breasts do well to go for checkup.
2. Redness or flaky skin colour in the area surrounding your breasts. If you’re suffering from breast cancer or about to face a full blown cancer of the breast, you may notice redness or flakiness of the skin surrounding the affected breast.
3. Pain in the breast close to the nipple area. Constant, unexplained pain in the breast of a woman should not be taken for granted or swept under the carpet. Reason being that breast pain not associated with menstrual cycle could be due to disastrous reasons. So make sure you get checked once you start feeling constant pain in the breast near the nipple area.
4. Swollen Lymph nodes in the armpit. The lymph nodes might swell up in reaction to the growing cancer cells in the breast. So never take it for granted especially if it’s accompanied by the aforementioned signs and symptoms.
