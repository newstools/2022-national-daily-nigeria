The Jonathan-for-president plot, championed by a cabal in the presidency, is thickening by the day.
National Daily has reported that the former president may likely defect from the PDP to the APC any time soon. He is said to be putting finishing touches to his purported planned defection.
The report said that a cabal has promised him that he would be the APC’s consensus candidate presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential polls.
Jonathan is said to be in the middle of fine-tuning his defection strategies and plans to return to Aso Rock.
But the plot could be a decoy for the execution of a grand plan in either of two ways.

The one that might be obvious to many discerning minds to see people is the fact that the North wants to use the Jonathan presidency as a shortcut to return to power. The powers behind the plot are well aware that Jonathan can only spend one term of 4 years in office, having previously done one term from 2011 to 2015.
However, there is a not-so-obvious side to the plot.
It is the possibility of the northern oligarchs using the Jonathan-for-president as a decoy for a more sinister plot.
By this, I mean that the northern cabal may give the APC’s presidential ticket to Jonathan quite alright to fulfill all righteous. By doing so, they would have demonstrated that they support power rotation to the South.
Meanwhile, they would work surreptitiously to ensure the emergence of a northern presidential candidate in PDP who they would support at the polls. Then, they would deliberately sabotage Jonathan to ensure that the northern candidate wins the polls.
Interestingly, it would not be the first time that would happen. The northern political establishment had sabotaged this same Jonathan before in 2015 and would do it again.
