The Speaker of Plateau State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abok Ayuba, who has been in troubled waters of the state politics defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday.
Rt. Hon. Abok Ayuba, who was removed from office, in a statement on Saturday in Jos, his Media Adviser, Samuel Kaze, declared that he has officially tendered his letter of membership withdrawal to the APC on March 18th, also sending a letter of intent to return to his earlier party, the PDP, at the party’s Local Government Secretariat in Angware, Jos East.
The speaker maintained that his defection was necessary in order to save Plateau State from failed leadership of the APC, which will lead Plateau to a state of total collapse if allowed.
Speaker Abok was purported to have been removed by eight out of the 24 lawmakers of the House of Assembly on October 28th. The two third requirement for the removal of the speaker is 16 of the 24 members. Invariably, the illegal removal was carried out by a minority 8 members.
Speaker Abok has, however, proceeded to the court of law to upturn the perceived illegal impeachment.
