Were Manchester City’s 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park bad enough? It was bad enough, but now the race for the 2021/2022 English Premier League title is wide open.
Before the second leg, many people thought Pep Guardiola would get revenge on Crystal Palace for the first time. That did not happen.
Patrick Viera did a great job with his team’s strategy on the night. They played well for the whole 90 minutes to earn a well-deserved point.
Because the Premier League table now looks so close, Liverpool and Chelsea fans might be the most excited.
Current EPL Standings
This means that Liverpool are now 4 points behind Manchester City, even though they have a game in hand and can still play. It’s Wednesday, so they’ll play Arsenal. If they win, they’ll be just one point behind Manchester City.
As for Chelsea, they are now 11 points behind Manchester City, but they still have a game in hand. If they win their outstanding, there will be an 8-point gap between them and City if they do.
Putting them back in the race to win the league title would be a big help for them if Arsenal beat Liverpool on Wednesday.
That means that if they win their last game, they will be 4 points behind Liverpool in third place.
In the next few weeks, Manchester City and Liverpool will play each other. A draw there would be a huge help to the Chelsea FC football team.
Liverpool and Manchester City will be two points and six points behind Thomas Tuchel’s team if they both win. If they both don’t lose, the gap will be 2 and 6. That will put them back in the title race.
There are a lot of “ifs” in this analysis, but we know that in football, anything can happen, and we’ve seen even more crazy things happen.
