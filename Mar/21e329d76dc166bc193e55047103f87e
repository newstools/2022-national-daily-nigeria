Few moments ago, a Facebook user named Abass Adetunji shared an opinion about the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine on his timeline and it stirred reactions from those who came across it.
One of those who reacted was a well known investigative Journalist named Babajide Kolade Otitoju (BKO). He said, “the way Nigerians talk about Russia, you would think it can not lose any war at all.” He added that sometimes, how Nigerians view the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine will make one assume that Russia “has won every war it engaged in.”
Babajide Otitoju continued by recounting some occurrences of the past. He said, “even when it was bigger than this, Russia was resoundingly defeated by Japan. This implies you can destroy cities and still not win a war.”
Aside Japan, Babajide Otitoju talked about Israel saying, “Israel learnt a bitter lesson against the Hezbollah in 2006 because the Defence Minister resigned in disgrace.”
Babajide Otitoju furthered his stance saying, “Israel didn’t achieve its aim of overrunning an insignificant Lebanese city. Yet the Hezbollah did not go on the offensive, they only defended their positions with anti-tank missiles.”
According to Babajide Otitoju, the fate of Israel was similar to that of Charles De Gaulle who was taught a lesson by Algerians. In similar vein, Babajide Otitoju posits that the United States of America (USA) was also taught a lesson in Vietnam because “it won every phase of that war but it retreated in disgrace after more than fifty thousand (50,000) United State’s soldiers were killed.”
