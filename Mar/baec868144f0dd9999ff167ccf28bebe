In the ongoing convention at the Eagle Square in Abuja, the APC caretaker committee doesn’t allow political appointees to vote or be voted for.
If anything, that should put to rest wild speculations about the likes of Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi, his works counterpart Babatunde Fashola, and Labour Minister Chris Ngige are gunning for the presidency in 2023.
The exclusion was revealed earlier in a statement on Thursday, expressly declared that “all political appointees who were elected as delegates to the National Convention slated for 26/3/2022 SHALL NOT VOTE in view of the controversy surrounding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.
The committee, however, stated that political appointees can still attend as observers.
The presidency is still contending the section of the law that excludes appointees from voting or being voted for.
A federal high court recently asked Justice Minister Abubakar Malami to delete the section.
But the NASS threatened to report he judge trying to usurp lawmaking from the federal legislature.
