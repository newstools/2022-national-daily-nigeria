The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has advised telecom subscribers to link their NIN with their SIM cards before the expiration of the March 31 deadline.
NCC through its social media handles reiterated the need for subscribers to comply with the directive and also ensure they register their SIM before the said date.
“If you have not linked your NIN to your SIM, hurry up and do so before the deadline,” the NCC said.
It would be recalled that the federal government in December 2021, extended the deadline for the NIN-SIM data verification to March 31 this year and urged Nigerians and legal residents to complete the process of enrollment, verification and NIN-SIM integration on or before the new date.

Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy had also conveyed the federal government’s approval for the latest extension of the deadline for the exercise.
The NCC had on several occasions extended the registration deadline from January 2021 to February, June, July, October and December 2021.
“This extension would enable the Federal Government to consolidate the gains of the process and accelerate the enrolment of Nigerians in key areas like the remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, and the registration of legal residents,” the government said.
Mobile subscribers are therefore advised to submit their NIN to update their SIM card registration, or risk disconnection.
As of December 2021, about 71 million Nigerians had enrolled for the NIN.
