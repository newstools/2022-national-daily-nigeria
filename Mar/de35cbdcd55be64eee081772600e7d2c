The UK Government has finally sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich who was the owner of Chelsea, a London based English football club.
The sanction came few days after the Russian owner offered Chelsea up for sale but unfortunately he was not able to sell the club before being sanctioned.
Aside from the fact that Abrahamovich will no longer be able to step into UK or do business there, Chelsea as a football club will be restricted from doing certain things.

The UK Government has announced that they will be granting Chelsea a special license to still operate even though their assets have been frozen. But there are certain restrictions they will be facing
Here it is
1. They can no longer sell match tickets
Chelsea fans can no longer buy match tickets except those that already have season-long tickets.
2. They can no longer buy big players
The fact that they will no longer be selling tickets means they won’t be making frofits from ticket sales. Their assets is frozen so they won’t have enough money to buy big players anymore.
This is a sad thing for all Chelsea fans but the UK has no option than to do freeze Russian assets in their country. They want to do everything possible to put an end to the war.
