The federal government has attributed the poor electrotype supply in Abuja, Lagos, and other parts of the country to low water level in the hydro dams in Nigeria. The Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, at the weekly State House briefing at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, explained that the low water level at the various dams has made it difficult for the generation of sufficient electricity for distribution.
Aliyu assured that the government is doing everything possible to improve the situation and ensure adequate supply of gas to encourage proper restoration of power to users across the country.
The Power Minister noted that the metering gap is reducing across the country with the roll out of one million meters for the first phase of the initiative, four million meters are waited for the second phase.
The power minister told distribution companies to desist from selling metres to electricity consumers, insisting that meter procurement is free.
Abubakar Aliyu further said that government is speeding up actions on the planned installation of 10 power transformers with additional 10 mobile substations for massive improvement of electricity supply across the country.
The monster decried the challenges of right of way are still obstructing power projects across Nigeria even when funding for the projects are already provided by the government.
“We are engaging with the state governors through the Nigerian Governors Forum to drive a holistic solution to these lingering issues. Some examples of critical projects held up by right of way are the Benin to Oshogbo which I’ve mentioned 330 KV line which is 250 kilometers, Ikot Ekepene to Ikot Abasi also 330 KV line 68 kilometer and the Kano-Katsina 330 KV line 180 Kilometer,” the minister declared.
