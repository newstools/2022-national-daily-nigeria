Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo in a judgment on an ex-parte application by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), asserted that the Electoral Act has become a valid law and cannot be altered without following due process of the law.
The Judge admitted the argument of the counsel to the PDP, James Ogwu Onoja SAN, that the proper place to challenge the validity of any existing law is a court of competent jurisdiction.
The judge, therefore,  restrained all the defendants in the suit from removing section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act or preventing it from being implemented for the purpose of the 2023 general elections.
The court adjourned to March 21 for further hearing.
