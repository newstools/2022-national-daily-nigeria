Led in evidence by defence counsel, Mr Ambali Obomeileh-Muhammad, SAN, Nasiru-Kabara took an oath with the Holy Qur’an before he started testifying.
The defendant denied committing the crime.
He said that he translated the meaning of the Hadith.
“I was only protecting Prophet Muhammad PBUH based on the comments against Him in the Hadith,” he said.
He testified that the prosecution made a mistake in the alleged charge filed against him.
“I only translated what I saw in the Hadith. It is not my interpretation.
“In my preaching, I did not blasphem Prophet Muhammad PBUH on his marriage with Nana Safiyya,” he said.
