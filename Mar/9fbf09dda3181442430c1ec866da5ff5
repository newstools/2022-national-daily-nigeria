Afenifere, a pan Yoruba cultural organization, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari over increasing incidence of terror5ism in the country after the Saturday attack at Kaduna Airport by terrorists. The group agitated that the Federal Government led by President Buhari should stop treating terrorists with kid gloves.
Afenifere in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, lamented that the assault on Kaduna Airport was an issue of serious concern. The group cautioned that Nigeria must not be allowed to go the way of Afghanistan.
Afenifere declared: “The Federal Government should immediately allow states to set up their own police forces, empower the existing security agencies, and stop treating terrorists with kid gloves.
“These must be done immediately so that Nigeria does not go the Afghanistan way.”
The group stated that all those who believe in freedom, peaceful co-existence, personal liberty, true knowledge, and progress should rise up with a view to ensuring that those who should act do so immediately.
Afenifere decried that between Friday and Saturday, communities were sacked in Kaduna, Niger, and Enugu states, including loss of lives and burning of property. The group decried that the situation is as though the country is at war in those areas.
Afenifere emphasized: “It is a matter of serious concern that these security infractions happened at a time that the government kept assuring us that it was on top of the situation. “Some of these attacks by terrorists even occurred in broad daylight, that of Kaduna airport and that of Enugu for instance.”
The group, then, demanded President Buhari to use the remaining 14 months left in his tenure to reverse the ugly fate that has be-devilled the country in all spheres of life.
