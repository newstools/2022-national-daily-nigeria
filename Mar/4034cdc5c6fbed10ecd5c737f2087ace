The Sokoto State Governor, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the PDP, had in Kaduna declared: “The President doesn’t understand Nigeria and the dynamics of modern governance.
“And we need, for us to really address the challenges of Nigeria’s situation today, to have at the top of the leadership of this country someone that understands Nigeria, itself.
“Someone that can reach out and consult and build consensus on issues that concerns Nigerians.
“You can only do that if you have the necessary network.
“We need someone that can unify this country, someone that is Pan-Nigerian, someone that understands the dynamics of modern day governance. Someone that has democratic governance experience, in terms of either being in the executive or legislative arm of government.”
Governor Tambuwal also lamented that the Buhari administration is a tale of forced marriage. The governor bemoaned the near collapse of the Nigeria’s economy under the current administration. He promised to turn the situation around if given the opportunity.
