A Grade I Area Court in Dei-dei, Abuja, on Wednesday sentenced six unskilled men, to nine months imprisonment each for assaulting their friend, Musubaliu Baita.

Each of them pleaded guilty and asked the court to temper justice with mercy.
The Judge, Sulyman Ola, convicted and sentenced the suspects following their admission to committing the offence.
“The court, having found the convicts guilty of the offence, in line with their plea for mercy and leniency,
“And as first time offenders, who did not waste the time and resources of the court, all six suspects are hereby sentenced to nine months imprisonment with an option to pay N40, 000 fine each,’’ Ola pronounced.
He further advised the convicts to be responsible citizens and desist from such act, stating that the judgement would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in any criminal act.
Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Mr Olaonipekun Babajide told the court that Musubaliu Baita, of 5th Avenue Gwarinpa, Abuja, reported the case at the Gwarinpa Police station, on Feb.15, at about 2:30 pm.
He said that the convicts and the complainant had a misunderstanding which ended up in a fist cuff.
The police said that the convicts ganged up against Baita and injured him in the eye and head.
He said during police investigation, the convicts admitted to the crime, adding that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 265 and 241 of the Penal Code Law.
