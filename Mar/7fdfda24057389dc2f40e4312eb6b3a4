“On March 23, a note with the list of the American diplomats declared ‘persona non grata’ was handed to the head of the American diplomatic mission who was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the TASS news agency reported on Wednesday, citing the ministry.
“The US side has been given firm notice that any hostile action by the United States against Russia will be  met with a resolute and appropriate response,” the statement read.
