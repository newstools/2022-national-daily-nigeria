The former senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Senator Shehu Sani has taken to his verified Twitter page to react after President Muhammadu Buhari boasted that APC has 41 million registered members.
Recall in the Convention held by All Progressive Congress on Saturday in Abuja that President Muhammadu Buhari revealed that there was an increase in the membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Buhari said that the party has recorded 41 million members.
Buhari noted that the record has made All Progressive Congress, APC, the largest political party in the country, and with that figure, they can win elections fairly.
While reacting to this, the former lawmaker, Shehu Sani said with the claim of 41 million registered members of APC, the figure of the party registered members was almost the same as the population of Ukraine.
More so, Shehu said the 41 million registered members of APC were more than the population of Canada.
In his tweet, the former lawmaker wrote below;
“With a claim of 41 million registered members, Nigeria’s ruling party now almost matched up the population of Ukraine Or more than the population of Canada.”
