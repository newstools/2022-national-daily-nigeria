As the 2023 presidential election is getting closer, the ruling parties and the opposition ones have been taking the necessary steps that will give them a higher chance of providing the next president of Nigeria in 2023.

However, recently, the ruling party, APC, has allegedly taken two steps and made decisions that may lead to a mass defection in their party, which may seriously affect them in the coming election.
The APC’s first move, which may result in mass defections, is to allegedly micro-zone their presidential ticket to Nigeria’s south-west region.
This decision might not go down well with many of the South East and South South politicians who have declared their intention to run for the coming election and may push them to defect from the party to the one that would treat them better.

Many of these politicians, who believe they deserve the APC ticket better than the south-west based on equity and fairness, may be left with no option but to defect to another party.
Another step that may cause a mass defection in the APC is the sudden removal of Mai Buni as the caretaker chairman of the APC, which is already trending and causing confusion in the country.

The decision to remove Mai Buni might lead to his defection with his loyalties to another party that may offer them something better. However, many of these people are members of the APC Cabals, and their defection could have a serious impact on the party in the 2023 Presidential election.
