There are indications that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have fired the party’s Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) National Secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe, following the sudden sack of the CECPC national chairman, Governor Mala Buni of Yobe State.
Accordingly, the statement issued by the APC CECPC on the zoning arrangement of the party for the National Convention on March 26 was signed by the Director of Publicity at the APC National Headquarters, Abuja, Salisu Na’inna Ɗambatta, in place of the national secretary who has been signing the Committee’s statements in the Governor Buni administration of the party.
Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Wednesday revealed that the CECPC has taken a decision on Akpanudoedehe. He declined to disclose what decision was taken on the national secretary by the committee. Governor El-Rufai maintained that the committee will make the decision known.
Akpanudoedehe was on Tuesday reported to have resigned from the CECPC; but he made a statement later in the day refuting the report that he has resigned. He said that he is still waiting for the report of his boss, the CECPC national chairman, Governor Buni, to return from Dubai, when a decision will be made. He said that if advised to resign, he will willingly do so, adding that he is not greater than the party or President Muhammadu Buhari, who he identified as leader of the party.
Governor El-Rufai had maintained that Governor Buni is no longer the APC CECPC national chairman, saying that when he returns from Dubai, he will not hold any position anymore, except the Governor of Yobe State, which he said is normal.
