In a statement by its Spokesman, Peter Afunaya, the service said university lecturers who are part of the ongoing strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Universities would also be part of the demonstrations.
The statement read in part, “The service is also aware of a plot to use students, striking university teachers, labour unions, disgruntled individuals and strategic groups as well as exploit the global energy situation to carry out a mass protest like the ENDSARS. This is despite ongoing efforts by the government to address the issues.
“While the service views the machination as unpatriotic, it is on the trail of the agents of destabilisation who are desirous of using violence to achieve ulterior goals.
“Though it has placed measures to disrupt these tendencies, it warns the ring leaders and their cohorts to desist from acts capable of causing a breakdown of law and order.”
The DSS also revealed plans to stoke violence in parts of the country particularly the North-Central.
“In a bid to achieve this, the sponsors have mobilised foot soldiers and held several meetings in and outside the target areas,” it said.
The DSS said it would work with other security agencies and go “after the sponsors of this scheme and ensure the law takes its course.”
It advised citizens to engage according to rules but should resist persuasions to be used to destroy their own country.
“Those who may wish to go contrary to the law will, however, face the consequences,” the DSS said.
