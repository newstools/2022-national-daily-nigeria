A well known Nigerian human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, has made it known that without the ministerial job, the former governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, would have been peoples choice for presidency in the year 2023.
Speaking further, she stated it clearly that many people are now wondering if Fashola’s performance as Lagos State governor was a mirage and his performance as Minister is the real him.
Aisha Yesufu made this disclosure while reacting to a tweet which was made by a twitter user, asking to know why Babatunde Fashola is not being seen as a potential candidate in 2023, despite all his miraculous performance as Lagos State governor, few years ago.
Based on what Aisha Yesufu just said here, I really do not agree with her that Fashola underperformed as a minister. He tried his best as a minister and also as a governor. We should all know that as a minister, he is under someone, so he might not be able to do some certain things without taking permission from his superior. But on the other hand, he was in charge the time he was the Lagos State governor.
