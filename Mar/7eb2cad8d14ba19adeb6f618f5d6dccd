While defending Buhari’s administration amid criticism resulting from the recent collapse, Ogunlesi said, “2021 appears to have had the lowest number of grid collapses since 2010.
“Which suggests increasing grid stability. Which doesn’t mean we still don’t have major grid issues, but maybe we’re headed in the right direction”, he tweeted.
