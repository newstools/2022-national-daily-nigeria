The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has sealed mansions reportedly belonging to a former governor of Anambra state, Willie Obiano.
The mansions situated at Ngozika Estate in Awka were traced to the APGA strongman by the commission.
A notice which reads: ‘EFCC, Keep Off. Under Investigation’ on the wall of an abandoned building traceable to Obiano, a development that followed his release after six days in the commission’s custody.
It would be recalled that Obiano’s passport was also seized following his arrest at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport on his way to Houston, United States of America, shortly after handing over to his successor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo on Thursday, March 17, 2022.
According to the spokesman of the Anti-Graft Commission, Wilson Uwajaren, Obiano is being investigated for fraud and embezzlement of public funds.
