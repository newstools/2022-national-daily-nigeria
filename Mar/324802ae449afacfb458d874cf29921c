The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has distanced himself from the report that he has informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his presidential ambition.

The media aide to Osinbajo, Laolu Akande described the report as false and mere speculation.

According to AIT, Akande in a chat with its correspondent said the report is not factual.

Earlier on Monday, there were reports that the Vice President had informed his boss about his intention to succeed him.

It was reported that a source claimed that President Buhari gave his blessing to his Vice as he has done for other presidential aspirants who have informed him of their intention.

The source further stated that President Buhari is being careful of supporting a presidential aspirant ahead of the 2023 general elections.

Recall that Osinbajo stated that he would declare his next move soon, as his commitment is to President Buhari.

He further stated that at the right time he would declare officially his plan.
