Reno Omokri has taken up on some former Eagles players who participated in the novelty match last weekend to shore up support for the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in Lagos. Reno Omokri made the innuendo that countries are going for young generation leaders, the former Eagles players generating support for a political leader whose fitness has been in doubt.
Reno Omokri displaying the pictures of Taribo West and George Opone Weah, President of Liberia, emphasized that Weah is a president building infrastructure in his country, Taribo West is praying for a political leader building stomach infrastructure.
Reno Omokri in a tweet on his official twitter handle wrote:  @renoomokri “The man in red is President of his country. The man in blue is praying for a man who urinates uncontrollably in public to be President of his country. “One is building public infrastructure; The other is building stomach infrastructure. Life is truly not balanced!”
In that picture, Taribo West was in Inter Milan, while Weah was in AC Milan in Itlay.
Many stakeholders in Nigeria had chided the former Eagles players captained by Austine Okocha that hunger drove them into participating in the Tinubu novelty match in Lagos.
Kanu Nwankwo, however, defended his participation saying he was involved because of Tinubu’s philanthropy.
Other players included Victor Ikpeba, George Finidi, Peter Rufai, and others.
