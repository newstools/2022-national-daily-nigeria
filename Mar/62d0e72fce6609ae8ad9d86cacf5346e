Ace Nigerian Journalist, Babajide Kolade-otitoju, has narrated his ordeal in the hands of some loan companies over debts he knew nothing about. Babajide shared the incidents while discussing the issue of illegal money lenders in Nigeria.

You may recall that the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) and its related agencies raided the premises of some illegal online money lenders in Lagos and froze their accounts. The action resulted from the pain inflicted on Nigerians by the affected companies.
Narrating his ordeal, Babajide said, “My colleague once obtained a loan from one of the companies, but he did not honor his agreement with them. However, the loan company began ‘harassing’ me, even though I was not aware of the debt nor how it happened. They insisted that I was the person who could make the said colleague repay their loan. I questioned them regarding their insistence before confronting the affected colleague regarding the development.”
Narrating a second ordeal, Babajide added, “Another former colleague of mine also obtained a loan from a company and defaulted on payment. They also started calling me. Some of these companies did not register in our company, and they do not have a fixed address, yet they obtained our vital details. This development could be disastrous.”
