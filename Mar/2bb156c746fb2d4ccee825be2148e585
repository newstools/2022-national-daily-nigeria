To drive the Presidential state car, one needs to be highly trained to handle any eventuality. Each master driver is a transport operator by military occupational specialty and must complete 540 hours of city familiarization training. They take their training very seriously. For example, prior to the presidential inauguration processions, simulated attack training is conducted to better prepare all involved with the procedures covering all foreseeable eventualities. The Mammoth undertaking of protecting the president, on the other hand, falls on the shoulders of the United States Secret Service, which runs the Presidential Protection Division.
These agents are highly trained in handling firearms in combat and in self-defense. Those selected to the presidential protective division will serve a minimum of six years to protect the president. The Secret Service Unit is also responsible for making sure the Presidential state car is in top condition and eventually demolishes it when it runs its course. When the beast is on the move, it is usually accompanied by a number of secret service counterassaults team vehicles, which can be changed depending on the situation and location to optimize safety. The route or pilot car leads the pack, followed by the sleepers made of police motorcycles and cars to clear the route.
The lead car goes ahead of the presidential state car and acts as a buffer to protect the Presidential state car. It is not unusual to see several identical presidential state cars deployed to act as a decoy against any attacks. Following the presidential state car is a modified SUV called the roadrunner that can detect projectiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The roadrunner is followed by support vehicles that carry the members of the cabinet, medical teams, members of the press, and a defense equipment truck.
