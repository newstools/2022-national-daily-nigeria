Some moments ago, a well known social commentator in Nigeria, Daddy Freeze, took to his verified Facebook page to talk about the presidential hopeful, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

During the live session, Daddy Freeze asked, “they say Tinubu is not healthy, was an American President not on a wheelchair?”
He clarified that the American President’s name is Franklin Roosevelt. He advised that as Nigerians look forward to the forthcoming presidential election, they should focus on the content of the aspirants and not be sentimental.
Daddy Freeze also questioned why people were dragging the ex-super eagles’ players that visited Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He said even if the meeting with the political gladiator was political, the ex-footballers have the right to support whoever they feel is right.
Daddy Freeze said he’s not a supporter of an old aspirant but if there are no youths vying for the presidency, he will choose anyone he loves among the old aspirants.
