They are charged with five others in relation to offences of unlawful drug dealings.
Justice Emeka Nwite, in a ruling on Monday morning, held that the prosecution has placed sufficient materials before the court to warrant the refusal of bail to both senior police officers.
He also ordered Kyari’s transfer to Kuje Prison in Abuja
Kyari has been in NAFDAC custody since  he got himself caged in a sting operation by the narc agency weeks ago.
