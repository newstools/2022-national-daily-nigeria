A Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday retrained the National Chairman and National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) “from tampering, changing, altering, removal and unlawful replacement of the Edo State PDP Executives as voted for, elected, and duly sworn in at the 2020 PDP State Congresses.”
The suit has been lingering for two years on the State PDP Executives.
The Judgement of the court on Thursday is believed to have “finally put to rest the issues of harmonisation, integration, or dissolution” of the State Executives until the end of their Constitutional Tenures in 2024.
Some PDP stakeholders have celebrated that the judgement is not only Victory for Edo PDP but Victory for PDP Nationwide and most importantly it is VICTORY for Democracy.
The State PDP has been at loggerhead in Edo over the control of the party structure. Governor Godwin Obaseki has insisted that the state PDP should be handed over to him as the leader. But the substantive PDP members who received Governor Obaseki and his supporters from the All Progressives Congress (APC) have been skeptical.
Meanwhile, the national leadership of the PDP on Thursday appointed a three-man committee which include Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delata State to mediate in the Edo PDP crisis and reconcile the party members.
