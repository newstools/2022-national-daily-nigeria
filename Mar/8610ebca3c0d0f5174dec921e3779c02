The union said Wike doesn’t take are of workers and pensioners in Rivers, and he would do worse things to Nigerian workers if he becomes president.
“We have seen what is happening here in Rivers State. Pensioners have not been paid their gratuity since the inception of this administration. Workers have not been promoted since the inception of this administration,” said the Rivers State NLC chairman, Mrs Beatrice Itubo said this during an interview on Rhythm 93.7 FM Port Harcourt,
“Everywhere in the secretariat, even the schools and hospitals are empty. No workers, people are not employed.”
Itubo said that personally she is not supporting Wike.
“Workers should come all out during the 2023 elections and vote for the candidates of their choice, who will be able to take the welfare of workers as a first charge. That is exactly what we are saying,” she added.
“Charity they say begins at home. Let him (Wike) come home and pay retirees their gratuities, pay pension arrears, promote workers and then employ.”
