Renowned human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu has taken to her official Twitter handle to react to the pictures of Chidinma Ojukwu circulating on social media. Recall that earlier today, the report had it that the alleged killer of SuperTV CEO, Chidinma Ojukwu was crowned Miss Cell 2022 at the Kirikiri prison situated in Lagos to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day celebrations.
However, since the pictures went viral on social media, it has generated a lot of mixed reactions. While some were of the thought that prisons are meant to be a correctional center and not a place for fun, others applauded the organizers of the contest.

While reacting to a tweet that commended the prison authorities for allowing Chidinma Ojukwu participate in the beauty contest, Aisha Yesufu questioned her status as an inmate. According to her, she simply asked if Chidinma Ojukwu, who has not been found guilty by the court of law could be regarded as an inmate.
