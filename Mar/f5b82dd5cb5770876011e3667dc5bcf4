Spokesperson of the Kwara state Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Tunde Ashaolu is dead.
He died of heart failure on Sunday evening,  24 hours after celebrating his 50th birthday in Abuja.
Former Senate President Bukola Saraki was said to have hosted Ashaolu and erstwhile chairman of Ekiti local government area of the state, to a get-together in Abuja on Monday.
The ruling APC in the state has reacted.
In a statement, APC’s Spokesperson Tajudeen Folaranmi acknowledged that the late PDP’s spokesperson gave himself to the patriotic task of deepening the political conversation in the state.
“We also commiserate with members of the deceased family whom the late Ashaolu has left behind.
“We pray with a fervency that the PDP family and the members of the immediate family of the deceased will find the fortitude to bear the loss and strength to carry on in this tragic moment,” the statement reads.
Saraki is one of the party stalwarts aspiring to take the PDP presidential primary ticket.
