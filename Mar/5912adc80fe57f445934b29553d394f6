A US senator, Lindsey Graham, has launched a campaign for the assassination of President Vladimir Putin of Russia after the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian forces. Graham in a televised interview Thursday evening announced the search for “somebody in Russia” to assassinate President Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine.
Senator Graham interacting with Fox News TV host, Sean Hannity, declared: “How does this end? Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate… and take this guy out.”
Senator Graham also in a series of tweets, declared: “the only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Is there a Brutus in Russia?”
He asked if “a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg” exists in the Russian military.
Senator Graham assured Russians, “You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service;” if they kill Putin now.
Senator Graham was once a close ally of former President Donald Trump. The senator had in the early hours of the day, moved for a resolution condemning President Putin and his military commanders for committing “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity.”
Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, had slammed Senator Graham over his statements, which her said were “unacceptable and outrageous.”
The Ambassador decried what he described as “off the scale” hatred towards Russia in the United States. He demanded “official explanations and a strong condemnation of the criminal statements.”
Anatoly Antonov argued: “It is impossible to believe that a senator of a country that promotes its moral values as a ‘guiding star’ for all mankind could afford to call for terrorism as a way to achieve Washington’s goals in the international arena.”
