A cyber fraudster aka yahoo boy has been captured on camera lashing out at his foreign client over the paltry amount sent to him.
He was speaking with the person over the phone and expressed anger that they sent just $10 to him.
The young man wondered why an amount like $500 was not sent to him, and he asked the what he is supposed to do with the 10 dollars.
It seems the person had told him to use it to buy pizza and this further provoked the yahoo boy, who started raining abuses on the victim.
