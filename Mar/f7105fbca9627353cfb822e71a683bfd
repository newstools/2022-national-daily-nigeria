Days after declaring his presidential ambition, Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike has warned the party to be honest to the  its constitution.
He also gave a condition on which he can put his ambition to rest.
The PDP recently inaugurated a 37-member committee to come up with a zoning arrangement for the party.
Speaking on a Channels TV on Monday Gov. Wike said he will “abide” by whatever position the party takes on the zoning arrangement.
Because the party ticket has been left free floating for anyone ma enough to contest, contestants from across the geo-political zones have sprung up.
Apart from ex-V.P. Atiku Abubakar, others including Govs Aminu Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed, and former Sen President Bukola Saraki have indicated interest
But the Governor said the position of the party’s constitution in “Section 7 sub 3c” is clear on the rotation of the presidential office.
“People should be sincere and abide to the norms of the constitution.
“It doesn’t matter because you believe that this is my time I will win let us jettison every other arrangement, ” he said, adding its unfair to say the southern candidate cannot win the presidential election in 2023.
