The former senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Senator Shehu Sani has taken to his verified Twitter page to react after Farooq Kperogi said there will be religious civil war in Nigeria if vice president Yemi Osibanjo becomes President.
It was reported that the US-based Nigerian academic, Farooq Kperogi, said it will be a time-bomb waiting to explode on the country if Osibanjo is allowed to become President.
According to him, he said it would be a mistake to allow Osinbajo to become Nigeria’s president unless the country is ready for a civil war that will occur out of the vice president’s religious one-sidedness.
However, Shehu Sani has reacted a few minutes ago. While reacting to this, the former lawmaker said some people were celebrating Farooq Kperogi for firing shots south bound. Adding to this, he said people that celebrated him today will come after him with a sword when he fires north bound.
In his tweet, the former lawmaker wrote below;
