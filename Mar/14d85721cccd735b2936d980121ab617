“The silicon value is an enabler, where innovations like this are created; so, we want to make Enugu the epicenter of innovations and this is just the beginning.
“We are going to do an incubator programme where software will meet hardware; so, there is definitely going to be more advancements; I am excited that this young man has created this and the Enugu State Tech Hub is going to take him to the next level.
“I am speaking for the Enugu Government; I know that the Governor, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is excited about this; that’s why he created the Enugu State Tech Hub in the first place, to be able to make innovations like this come stay, at the end of the day, it will be a place people will like to come.”

“What we have succeeded in doing now is to put to use a tricycle that will run without fuel; all you need to do is to charge the battery and you are good to go. The electricity-tricycle will replace gasoline-powered tricycle from our roads. It enables it to run without fuel; it has the capacity to run as fast as 60 kilometres per hour.
