The party’s National Reconciliation & Strategy Committee chaired by Saraki had earlier last year made that recommendation to the party.
Reacting to the move, Saraki, “Following the recommendation of the #OfficialPDPNig National Reconciliation & Strategy Committee early last year, I applaud the moves by our party to sustain further youth inclusion by slashing the cost of nomination and expression of interest forms for youth by 50%.
“Once again, #OfficialPDPNig has shown that we are working to sustain a collaborative atmosphere between the older and younger generation, as we look forward to rescuing Nigeria in 2023.”
