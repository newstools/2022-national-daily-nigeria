President Volodymyr Zelenksy of Ukraine is under pressure over Ukraine neutrality in Eastern Europe as a condition to end Russian military operations. Zelensky revealed on Sunday that the demand for  Ukrainian neutrality by Russia is deeply being considered by Ukrainian negotiators.
According to Zelensky, “This point of the negotiations is understandable to me and it is being discussed, it is being carefully studied.”
Sweden and Austria had earlier in the month suggested models of neutrality for Ukraine which is part of the negotiations with Russia to end the military operations in Ukraine.
The Ukraine president ignored the suggested models, insisting that only Ukraine can design its own model acceptable to Ukrainians.
However, Zelensky in a media interaction complained that President Vladimir Putin of Russian is dragging out negotiations and prolonging the conflict.
Zelensky had stated, “We have to come to an agreement with the President of the Russian Federation. But to reach an agreement, he has to get up from where he is and come and meet me.”
Meanwhile, Russian media regulator, Roskomnadzor, had cautioned the Russian media organization not to broadcast the interaction with Zelensky, threatening that they may be subject to investigation and action could be taken against them.
