The fast-food chain, Chicken Republic has denied firing two security guards, for dancing while at their duty posts.
The videos of the two young men doing a dance routine had gone viral on social media on Thursday amidst claims that they had been fired.
However, in a statement on its official Instagram page, the eatery said, it did no such thing, in fact, that the guards do not work for them.
Part of the statement read, “It is disappointing that some people may have the impression that the Chicken Republic fired these security guards for dancing in our stores, this is not true, and hence, we need to set the record straight.
“We take the safety and security of our customers, staff, and assets very seriously and as such, we outsource our security to various private security companies that specialise in such services. The two security guards in the video work for such a private security company.
“When the management of the private security company saw the two security guards dancing in the video, they had concerns that the security officers whilst dancing were not necessarily conducting their duties responsibly.
“We have followed up with the security company and they have assured us that the security guards have not been fired, have been paid their dues and have been offered some retraining.”
