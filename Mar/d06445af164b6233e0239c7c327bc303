He said this at an international symposium organised to mark his 85th birthday at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
Amog those who have made a Mecca of Obasanjo’s Abeokuta home were Dele Momodu, Bukla Saraki, Atiku Abubakar, Donald Duke, Bauchi Gov Bala Mohammed, ex-Gov Sule Lamido, Peter Obi.
Many of these have signified interest in the presidential race one way or another, and some were already linked to the former president..
“I was told that social media credited to me names of three people from the south that I am sponsoring for Presidency in 2023.
“My friend, Professor Ango Abdullah, who brought this to my knowledge remarked that he did not believe that I made such a statement because it was out of my character,” he said.
“I have neither named names nor stated my position.
“In situation like the one we are in, I will not rush into naming names without necessary consultations and well-defined principles and criteria. We need to be clear about what Nigeria needs today and why Nigeria needs it. Only then can we answer the question of how that will inform us of the criteria.”
