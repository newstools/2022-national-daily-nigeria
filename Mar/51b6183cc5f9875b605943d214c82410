The defendant, who resides at Ajegunle, is being tried for conspiracy and defilement.
The prosecutor, Insp Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant and one other now at large, committed the offence on Jan. 11 at Oguntokun Street, Ajegunle, Lagos.
Ihiehie said that the victim was hawking when the defendant and his accomplice called her on pretext of buying wares from her.
He said one of them covered her mouth, while the second carried her to the bush in their backyard and the duo had canal knowledge of her.
He added that the victim was left in the bush and she went home to report to her mother, who reported the incident to the police.
He noted that the offences contravened sections 137 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The Chief Magistrate, Mrs O.A. Layinka, who did not take the plea of the defendant, directed the police to return the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice.
Layinka adjourned the case until April 4 for mention.
