Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel does not want to consider his future at all in this moment of time, says journalist Dean Jones.
The 48-year-old has been linked with the Manchester United job amid the crisis at Stamford Bridge, but it does not seem like he is angling for a way out of the west London club.
According to the Daily Mail, United are keeping tabs on Tuchel in case he becomes available at the end of the season.
The German still has over two years left on his contract, but with Chelsea in a paralysed state following the sanctioning of owner Roman Abramovich, everything is up in the air in the blue part of west London right now.
There is a confidence that the Blues will be sold to new owners in a development that would allow the club to operate normally again. But until that goes through, talk of Tuchel departing the Bridge is likely to continue.
Winning the Champions League in his first season at Chelsea, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund manager is easily one of the best coaches in the world so will undoubtedly be in-demand should he become available.
