Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are generally spread if you engage in intimacy with an infected person. The bacteria, viruses, or parasites that cause sexually transmitted infections may spread from person to person through blood, the male gamete, fluid made by the female organ, and other fluids in the body.
According to “Healthline”, symptoms of sexually transmitted infections may range from mild to severe and they affect many parts of the body.
After the initial infection, it can take certain days, weeks, months, or even years before you start noticing symptoms.
But it’s also common for some sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and hepatitis B, to be asymptomatic. This shows that people may not even have the knowledge they have. Some of the major symptoms of sexually transmitted infections include:
1. Your urine colour can change to dark if you have hepatitis B.
2. Abnormal discharge from the female organ, male organ, or anal area can occur if you have chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis.
3. Itchiness in the genital area may occur due to genital herpes and pubic lice.
4. Feeling pain while peeing or having intimacy can be an indication that you have chlamydia, gonorrhoea and genital herpes.
5. Bleeding between periods or after engaging in intercourse is a major sign of chlamydia.
6. People infected with hepatitis B may feel pain in their joints and muscle.
7. Small blisters or sores in the genital area are common symptoms of syphilis and genital herpes.
8. You may feel pain in your pelvic region if you suffer from chlamydia.
Always adhere to healthy lifestyles to prevent yourself from being infected with sexually transmitted infections.
