The UK justice minister, Dominic Raab, on Tuesday said that Russian President, Vladimir Putin and Russian commanders could be brought before the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
They should be brought to ICC for allegedly committing war crimes during the military operation currently undergoing in Ukraine.
“There is a clear determination from the international community to make sure that any war crimes are held to account whether it is Putin or those around him in Moscow or commanders on the ground,” Raab said.
Raab, who is also UK deputy prime minister, told LBC radio, adding that ICC was actively looking at the reports coming out of Ukraine.
In the early hours of February 24, Russia launched a military operation to denazify Ukraine.
The Russian Defence Ministry said the special operation was targeting Ukrainian military infrastructure only and the civilian population was not in danger.
