The job of a striker is to score goals, but occasionally, they could score in their net and make their team lose games and points. Own goals are never intentional, but a Super Eagles player scored one, and it made his team drop into second place in the league.
Slavia Prague went into the clash against Slovan Liberec as league leaders, but the game ended 1-0 in favor of Liberec and the only goal of the game was an own goal from Super Eagles striker, Peter Olayinka.
Olayinka was the hero during the Europa Conference League fixture against LASK, he captained the side and scored in the 4-1 victory. The loss means a lot to the Czech champions, who could now lose the title to Viktoria Plzen, that are presently leaders.
There are only 5 matches left in the league and if both Plzen and Slavia Prague win all their games, Plzen would be champions, and it would be because Slavia Prague lost today’s game.
