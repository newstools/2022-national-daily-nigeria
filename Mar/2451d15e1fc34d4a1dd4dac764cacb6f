An old video of actress Mercy Aigbe advising ladies about having romantic relationships with married men has been trending on social media.
In the video, Aigbe said, “If you do, your head needs to be examined. Huh, na me talk am.
“If you are dating a married man, chop his money, collect his money, because that man is already married. What else are you doing?
“Some stupid girls will be dating married men and be doing love. Sis, he’s not yours. He belongs to another woman. So use your brains. If you are dating a married man, make sure you are in it for the material things.”
Aigbe recently became the second wife of movie marketer, Kazim Adeoti.
Meanwhile, Adeoti’s first wife, Funso has accused Aigbe of sleeping with her husband while they were friends.
