Japan will work closely with G7 member states in deciding its stance on the ban of Russian oil imports imposed by the United States, a Japanese media reported on Wednesday, citing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
On Tuesday, Washington decided to ban all Russian energy imports as part of sanctions against Moscow in response to the military operation in Ukraine.
London said that it would halt oil imports from Russia by the end of this year.
According to the Kyodo News Agency, Kishida told reporters that Tokyo will be in close contact with Washington over the matter.
He added that the government would take into account the national security and stable energy deliveries.
Russia launched the operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24, after the breakaway Donbas Republics appealed for help in defending themselves against the Ukrainian military.
In response, Western nations had rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.
