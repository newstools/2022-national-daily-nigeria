Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the US President Joe Biden to spare Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich of sanction, though the UK has hit the Russian billionaire very hard.
According to a report by the UK Mirror, Zelensky believes the club owner could be of help considering his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin whose war campaign just got past a month in Ukraine.
Abramovich has answered a call from Zelensky’s aides to help broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.
And Biden is ready to do Zelensky’s bidding.
The report added that the White House has reportedly persuaded the US Treasury Department not to go ahead with plans to target Abramovich and his businesses.
The US has yet to target any of Abramovich’s assets, and may not do so after Zelensky’s call to White House.
The UK, however, has ratcheted up its asset freezes and travel bans on Russian oligarchs who are Putin’s chums.
