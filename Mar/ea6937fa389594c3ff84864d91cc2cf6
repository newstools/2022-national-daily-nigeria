The crisis began Monday night when a Yoruba man and a Hausa man had a misunderstanding.
It was presumed the Hausa an died, which prompted his tribesmen to go on the rampage, destroying properties and attacking people.
The Seriki Hausa (head of Hausa settlers) called to intervene in the crisis was seriously injured.
“The man is currently receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba”, a source said.
The Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident, saying the situation had been brought under control.
He said no life was lost.
“I’m aware of the clash, but the situation has been brought under control. We have made some arrests. I don’t want to disclose the number of persons we have arrested, but we have made some arrests,” he said.
“We are still investigating the clash. The crisis is a result of a rumour because there was a clash between a Hausa man and a Yoruba man. I think the Hausa man was injured and some people went to town with the rumour that the injured man died and that was what led to the whole thing and the issue escalated.
Meanwhile, traders who lost their wares to the crisis blamed the police for not responding when the report got to the Lanfenwa police station.
