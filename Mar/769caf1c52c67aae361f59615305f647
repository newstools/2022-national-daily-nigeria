The CAC’s Registrar-General gave the directive in a March 4, 2022 circular signed on his behalf by Tolulope Sonaike.
Titled “Registration of schools and academies” and addressed to “Approving Officers (Name Availability and Business Names)”, the circular said,  “The Registrar-General has directed that henceforth Schools, Academies and such other institutions of learning should not be approved or registered as business names.
“This is because an institution is essentially a body corporate with perpetual succession, capable of contracting and (subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by other laws) issuing certificates in its own name, which attributes are absent in a business name.
“All Approving Officers (AOS) for Name Availability and Business Name registration are hereby advised to note the above and be guided accordingly.”
