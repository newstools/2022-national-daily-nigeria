Embattled Chairman of Lagos State Council of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo), has clarified the directive given to union’s members to sell tickets at motor parks.
According to him, the tickets are the ones issued by the State Government pegged at N800.
The Lagos State Government in January introduced a daily N800 consolidated informal transport levy for transporters.
Akinsanya said the union has no right to stop the selling of the tickets since they’re for the State Government.
“The permission is strictly for the Lagos State government tickets for consolidated transport levy, not union fee,” he said.

He urged the public to dismiss the misinformation on social media.
Akinsanya appealed to journalists to verify information from the appropriate quarters before going to press.
“We’re law-abiding people and we’ll not go against the decision of the State Government by taking laws into our own hands. The union activities remain suspended as directed by the government,” he said.
