However, Obasanjo’s spokesman, Kehinde Akinyemi, said the former President was misrepresented.
In a statement he issued, Akinyemi berated Ohuabunwa for being behind the misrepresentation.
He accused the Presidential aspirant of using a wrong approach in the bid to achieve his ambition.
The statement reads: “If that was the way the presidential aspirant wanted to approach his ambition; such was the wrong way.
“He came here and the former President received him as a gentleman and in the spirit of his 85th birthday celebrations only for him to go and put words into his mouth. Baba is not that sort of man and if that is the way he wants to fulfil his ambition that is the wrong way.”
