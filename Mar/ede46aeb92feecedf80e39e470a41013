Protesters in the Turkish port of Bodrum tried to block “My Solaris,” a yacht with reported ties to Russian oligarch from docking on Monday.
The reported members of the Odessa Children and Youth Sailing School — commonly referred to as the Optimist Sailing Club — were carrying Ukrainian flags and signs reading “No war.”
“It was the whole team’s decision to block the approach of the yacht of the Russian oligarch Abramovich,” team coach Pavlo Dontsov told CNN.
“We raise the flag of our country at many international competitions. We just want to show everyone who Ukraine is.”
