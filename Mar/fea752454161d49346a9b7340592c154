Director-General of the state corporation Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin denied claims about the loss of communication with Russian satellites after an alleged hacker attack on Wednesday.
Earlier in the day, international hacking group Anonymous said on Twitter that its affiliate NB65 had shut down the Roscosmos Control Centre, claiming that Russia had lost control over its satellites.
“The information of these scammers and petty swindlers is not true. All our space activity control centres are operating normally,’’ Rogozin said on Twitter.
After Russia launched its special operation in Ukraine on Thursday, Anonymous declared a “cyberwar against the Russian government.’’
In the past few days, Russian government agencies and the media have reported hacking attacks on their websites.
