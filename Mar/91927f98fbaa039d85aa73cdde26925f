According to the command’s spokesman, Adekunle Ajisebutu, the police chief described the incident as “reprehensible”.
The state Safety Commission and the Rapid Response Squad earlier sealed off Havillah Event Centre, Oniru, where the event took place,  “for contravening public safety rules”.
The commissioner had also said it was dangerous to indulge in such practice and therefore, advised Lagosians to avoid actions that can lead to loss of lives and property.
The host’s name, ‘The Erelu Okin Foundation Installation Party’ and her photograph were printed o the containers.
“It’s regrettable that in spite of series of warnings and sensitisations carried out by the Police and other relevant government agencies, some individuals could be handling such combustible substance in a public place in total disregard to safety of lives and properties.
“Still concerned about the safety, and protection of lives and properties of citizens, the Lagos State Police Command once again appeals to citizens to avoid this kind of condemnable act in the name of generosity.
“Although the event centre where the distribution of the souvenirs took place has been located and subsequently sealed, the Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, fdc, mnim, has in addition, ordered the arrest of all persons involved in this regrettable and reprehensible act.”
