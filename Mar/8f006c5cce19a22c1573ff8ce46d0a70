FIFA has officially kicked Russia out of the 2022 World Cup qualifying series.
Russia’s opponents, Poland, have been given the slot in the Path B playoff final on March 29.
Poland was due to face Russia in the semi-final of the playoff process days earlier. But the Polish FA and players insisted they did not want to play against Russia.
Poland will now face either Sweden or the Czech Republic in the final.
“Subsequent to the decision of 28 February 2022 taken jointly with the UEFA Executive Committee to suspend all Russian teams from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice, the Bureau of the FIFA Organising Committee decided that Poland will receive a bye to the final of Path B due to take place on 29 March 2022, in which they will face the winners of the match between Sweden and the Czech Republic,” a statement by FIFA read in part.
