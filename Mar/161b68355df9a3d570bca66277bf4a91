The Chinese Embassy to the United States on Wednesday urged Chinese citizens, residing in the country, to take measures ensuring their personal safety amid rising discrimination against Chinese in the U.S.
“Make sure you reinforce your safety precautions.
“If you encounter targeted discrimination and violence, remain calm, handle it correctly, try to avoid quarrels and physical conflicts.
“You should pay attention to collecting evidence to ensure your own safety,” the embassy’s statement said.
The embassy noted that there is much hatred towards China in the U.S.
“Many Asians have faced assaults, particularly those who work in Chinese-funded institutions and international students,” the  embassy said.
