The insecurity in northwest Nigeria is worsening by the day despite the efforts of the government to restore law and order in the country.  Terrorists on Tuesday morning invaded the Saint John’s Catholic Church, Kudenda, Kaduna South Local Government Area, Kaduna State, kidnapped the parish priest, Reverend Father Joseph Aketeh, and killed the security guard.
It was gathered that the Chancellor of the Catholic Deanery of Kaduna Diocese, Reverend Father Anthony Dodo, acknowledging the incident, narrated that the gunmen stormed the parish house in the early hours of Tuesday, shot the gate man to death, then proceeded to the main building where the priests are living.
Catholic Deanery was said to have revealed that the terrorists broke into one of the rooms while the priest was asleep, and whisked him to an unknown destination, adding that other priest narrowly escape from the terrorists.
Meanwhile, the Kaduna State government and the state police command are yet to acknowledge the incident.
