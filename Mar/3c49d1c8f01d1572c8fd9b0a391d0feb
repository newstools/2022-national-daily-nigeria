Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State on Monday lost his suit at the Federal high Court, Abuja, seeking stay of execution of the judgment of the Federal High Court which ordered him to vacate office for defecting to the All Progressives Congress (APC) with the mandate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja threw out the suit for stay of execution of the judgment that ordered Umahi and the Deputy Governor Kelechi Igwe to vacate office after defecting to the APC. The court in the judgment noted that the suit is already instituted before the Court of Appeal, adding that the matter can no longer be entertained in the Federal High Court.
