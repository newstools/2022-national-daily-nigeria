Through GOLDEN MORN Agripreneurship Webinar Series, young agripreneurs with focus on grains, are exposed to relevant training on different aspects of the agricultural value chain and are provided with seedling and mentorship to help them succeed as farmers post training.
The GOLDEN MORN Agripreneurship Webinar Series seeks to train and provide support to young entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector in order to promote sustainable food systems. The series is open to all budding or existing agric-based entrepreneurs aged 18 to 35 years, through a selection process.
