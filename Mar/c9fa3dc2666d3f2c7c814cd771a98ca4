The former governor has never sowed interest, but the media and armchair pundits and supporters, including the Amaechi Vanguard have.
Amaechi, in light of the go-man-go, declared he only needed money to survive and not the presidential seat.
“The people that want me to run for the presidency in 2023 should just give me the money. I need money to survive,” he said on Arise TV.
In spite of the  declaration against such ambition,  supporters have flooded the Eagle Square in Abuja, where the National Convention of the All Progressive Congress was held, with his posters.
