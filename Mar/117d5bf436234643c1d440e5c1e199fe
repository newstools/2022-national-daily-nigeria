Ghana is in Mariga LGA, Niger.
The attacks was part of the  aerial operation by the Nigerian Airforce (NAF), Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike and Operation Gama Aiki, which started  Wednesday between 4.45 pm and 6.34 pm in some bandit camps within Ghana.
According to reports, the terrorists have been under surveillance for some time and were observed to be in three different groups of approximately 40 terrorists, with at least 25 motorcycles per group.
PRNigeria reported that rather than strike individual group separately, which may not achieve the desired outcome, the surveillance team patiently waited until the three groups gathered at a crossroad location near Ghana Village.
A military intelligence source, privy to the operation, revealed that precision strikes of troops had a 100 percent accuracy, going by the intensity and spread of the fireball which entirely engulfed the terrorists.
“At least nothing less than 150 terrorists perished in that strike,” the source was quoted as saying.
A minimal number of survivors were however seen crawling or barely limping off from the location, which the ground troops immediately mopped up.
The Niger State Government, through the Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Affairs, Mr Emmanuel Umar, at a briefing in Minna on Wednesday, confirmed that over 200 terrorists were killed by military air strikes and other joint operatives in some Villages in Mariga LGAs and other parts of the state between 28 February and 2 March 2022.
NAF Spokesperson Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the incident.
