When Chelsea football club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, was hit with a very heavy fine by the UK government, the future of the club was in doubt. But the blues want to sell the Club as soon as possible.
Chelsea’s sale was put on hold for a while because of the sanctions Roman Abramovich was given. However, the UK government had given the go-ahead for the sale of Chelsea football club to go forward.
A fan of the club from Saudi Arabia, Mohamed Alkhereji, has made an offer of £2.7bn ($3.5bn) to buy the club. This is good news for the sale of the club.
According to reports, the Group is worth $1.3trillion, which would make them the richest club owner in the world. Newcastle owners, who are said to be worth £350bn, are in second place.
And if the deal is done, Chelsea football club will be the richest club in the world.
