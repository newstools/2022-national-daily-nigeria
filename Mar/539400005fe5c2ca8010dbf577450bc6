2023 elections is barely a year away and major political parties are already positioning to grab power. The ruling party, the All Progressive Congress has seen its stock falling down which is largely due to the perception by many Nigerians that the challenges Nigeria is attributed to the incompetence of the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Former Lagos State Governor, Ahmed Bola Tinubu and the incumbent governor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello and other bigwigs in APC currently eyeing the seat of power and looking to succeed President Buhari and become the next Nigeria leader.
Considering the challenges currently facing the nation, which some Nigerians blame President Buhari Muhammadu and the ruling party, whoever gets the APC’s presidential ticket already faces two dilemmas which may truncate his ambition.

Whoever clinches the APC presidential ticket will have to either campaign on continuity or rubbish the present administration of President Buhari.
If the presidential candidate chooses continuity, it may prove costly as he will come under intense scrutiny and he will have to answer the questions of many Nigerians about the incompetence and failings of the present administration.
If the candidate chooses to go the opposite, he would be campaigning against the current government and will have to open many cans of worm in order to swing public support to himself.
In summary, whoever gets APC presidential ticket either go these two ways;
“We will continue from where President Buhari stops,” or “We will fix the damages caused by Muhammadu Buhari.”
Whatever way the next APC presidential candidate chooses will determine if he will go far in his campaign and emerge as the next president of Nigeria come 2023.
