Nigerians have been reacting after it was reported that the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and his deputy, Eric Kelechi were sacked by a Federal High Court in Abuja, for defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC.
Based on that note, a well known Nigerian human rights activist, Adeyanju Deji, decide to react. While reacting, he described the judgement that was delivered by the court as a sound legal judgement.
It should be recalled that the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi and his Deputy, Eric Kelechi, left the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in 2020.
Based on this particular judgement that was recently delivered by the court, I really think that the judgement is a wonderful judgement, because other governors and elected officials will learn one or two lessons from what just happened to the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi.
