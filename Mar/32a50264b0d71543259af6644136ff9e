Chelsea defensive midfielder N’golo Kante has picked up an injury while on international duty with France and has since returned to Chelsea to recover.
The injury has not been made known yet but it was announced that N’golo Kante has left the France camp and will head back to London. The season is almost over with only a few games to go and if N’golo Kante injury is a serious one he will miss the rest of the season.
This is not good news to Chelsea fans because N’golo Kante is the only defensive midfielder they have, both Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic are Central midfielder. But Ruben Loftus Cheek can replace the injured N’golo Kante because he is strong and can tackle.
After the international break Chelsea takes on Brentford and N’golo Kante won’t be available for the match also Andreas Christensen won’t be available too due to the injury he picked up against Newcastle united
