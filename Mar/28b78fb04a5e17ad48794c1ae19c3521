While the government is still running around on the Monday attack on a Kaduna bound train, bandits on Tuesday launched a second attack on Gidan Train Station on the Abuja-Kaduna rail corridor.
The bandits were said to have planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on the rail tracks, obstructing the movement of a train conveying passengers to Abuja from Kaduna.
The attack is coming less than 24 hours after the Monday blast on the same rail corridor.
