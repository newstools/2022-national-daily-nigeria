Presidential hopeful, Omoyele Sowore, has called out the Lagos State University, LASU, and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu over campaign posters of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu inside a convocation hall of the university.


In a post on social media, Sowore stated that an academic environment ought not to appear the way it did with Tinubu’s poster.
He, therefore, called for the resignation of the Vice Chancellor and management of the school.

Sowore wrote, “Lagos State University (LASU) Convocation grounds desecrated! This is not what an academic environment ought to be. LASU Vice Chancellor and the management of the university should resign, I know the visitor (Gov. Sanwoolu) can’t act because he caused this rubbish due to political desperation.
No university should brazenly bastardize its environment like this. WeCantContinueLikeThis.”
Tinubu, whose poster was allegedly seen inside the convocation hall, is contesting for Presidency.
He’s a former governor of Lagos State and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress who is believed to be the clear favourite to Nan the party’s presidential ticket.
