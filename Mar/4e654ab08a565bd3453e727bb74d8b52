Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea’s manager, has announced that the Blues will fly to Lille for their Champions League match on Wednesday. Following the club’s punishments, there had been some concern about how the team would get to France.
Barclays is said to have stopped the club’s bank accounts, with the Blues being handed spending constraints.
“We’re getting an aircraft,” Tuchel stated. As a result, we’ll be able to fly out and return. We’ll take the train if it doesn’t work out. We’ll take the bus if that isn’t an option. I’ll drive a seven-seater if it doesn’t work out. I’ll do it, honestly. Mark my words: I’ll make every effort to get there.
“If you had asked me 20 or 30 years ago if I would attend a Champions League match on the sidelines and what I would do, I would have said, ‘fine, where do I have to be and when?’ Why is it necessary to alter this?.
“I’ll be there with you, and we’ll be there with you.” Of course, there are conversations and talks going on in terms of organization, but they have no bearing on me. That’s what I mean; we have fantastic trip organizers, and we have so dedicated employees in every area that things are now feeling relatively typical.”
