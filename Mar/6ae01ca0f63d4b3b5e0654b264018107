Guarantee Trust Bank (GTB) has continued to lead in technological innovations in the banking sector especially with the new provision of a machine for customers to enable them print their debit cards themselves in less than one minute.
In most banks today, customers are always subjected to standing in long queues at the customer service segment to get a new debit card but with GTBank, the narrative has changed.
Instead of being an activity done totally by the bank’s staff, it has become a self-help service. All you have to do is enter your account number, your fingerprint, then print card.
Guaranty Trust Bank since its inception into the banking sector have been taking the lead in these technological innovations.

Many customers wouldn’t have believed they could do a cardless withdrawal if not for GTBank’s innovation, some wouldn’t have believed it’s possible to withdraw with just their fingerprint if not for GTBank’s numerous technological innovations.
With the new machine for printing debit cards, GTBank has successfully reduced the high influx of customers in the banking hall and it’s just a matter of time before the bank totally eliminates the crowd in banking halls in Nigeria because other banks will see this innovation and follow suit.
As a matter of fact, GTBank isn’t bringing in these innovations for pride alone, it’s also to reduce the workload on staffers and this shows how considerate the organization is.
On twitter, GTBank is currently trending due to the machine for printing debit cards.
