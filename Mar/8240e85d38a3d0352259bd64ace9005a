The Chairman of NURTW in Lagos, Musiliu Akinsanya Ayinde, popularly called M. C. Oluomo has taken to his Facebook page to react to his appointment as ambassador on war against drug abuse by Lagos State NDLEA. See his post below.




After he made this post above, Nigerians trolled his page to react to the appointment as follows.




This is a good appointment by the NDLEA. MC Oluomo is widely known in Lagos as a leader and many people have associated the NURTW with thuggery and drug abuse, but this appointment has proved them wrong that not all of them are into drug abuse or thuggery. MC Oluomo has shown a good example to his colleagues in the NURTW and that is why the NDLEA will deem it fit to grant him such an important appointment.
Drug abuse has become a menace among people in the country and needs to be treated as a matter of urgency. Many Nigerians have applauded the good leadership of Buba Marwa in removing all traces of drug abuse in Nigeria. The truth is that the difference has been clear since he took up the mantle of leadership in the organization. It is hoped that drug abuse will be eradicated in Nigeria in a few years to come.
