The Adamawa police has however arrested Kama Hammajoda, the bad loser the victim said threatened her when she told him she would not marry him.
“He had threatened my life when I told him that our relationship would not lead to marriage,” she told the police.
She also explained why she believes her gut feelings about the perp.
Hammajoda is two-timer and liar, she noted.
“For instance, he told me that he was not married, but I found out he lied about it,” she said.
“I confronted him about it, and in a heated argument, I told him I won’t marry him.”
He then threatened.
“If you don’t marry me, everyone will lose,” she quoted him as saying.
“Shortly thereafter, my mother was burnt to death in her room; but as of that time, I couldn’t link it to Hammajoda’s threat.”
Her own experience happened last Sunday.
“I was lying down in the open within our compound due to power outage when someone tiptoed in the dark and poured acid on me,” she said.
It had to be Hammajoda.
The mechanic from Song is now denying the allegations as he kicks his heels in police cell; Ladi is licking her wounds in an undisclosed hospital in Yola.
