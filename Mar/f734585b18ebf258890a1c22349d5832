A well-known member of the ruling party (APC) Agbalanze Nnewi best known as Joe Igbokwe has taken to his official Facebook page to share a new post as he says “Protect The 2nd Niger Bridge, Railway, Power Plants, Dangote Refinery & Airports”
The elder statesman noted that the second Niger bridge, railway, power plants, Dangote refinery, airports, and the bad roads in the country and others should be protected which implies that he is calling on the Federal Government to take responsibility.
Furthermore, he stated that some people are appearing to be desperate, intimidated, anxious, confused, and also lost as he affirms that it is because of the forthcoming general election in 2023. Moreso, he said that he is urging everyone to be aware of the fact that there are still going to be more desperate destructions gruesome killings of innocent citizens and it would be for the same purpose (election).
In conclusion, he said those individuals are scared of what tomorrow will be like because this moment seems to be the last lap before the deed day. However, the Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo-Olu on Drainage and Water Resources whose statement seems like a parable didn’t mention the names of those he was talking about however it seems like he might be referring to the opposition party.
