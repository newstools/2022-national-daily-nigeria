The immediate past governor of Anambra taken into custody last Thursday, following allegations of financial mismanagement.
A video of Obiano in custody  at the EFCC headquarters, Abja, has been trending online, and the protesting women are unhappy about it.
In a statement issued to journalists in Awka, on Monday, the chairperson of the group, Mrs Uju Ifunanya Edochie, accused EFCC of displaying “unruly acts”.
“The Anambra-North Women Empowerment Movement hereby issue stern admonitions to EFCC for its reckless and unprofessional behaviour towards handling the case of the Obiano.
“We the women of the state strongly condemn the vile trending online video clip of Obiano while in EFCC custody. It is quite obvious that the particular video was taken without his knowledge nor consent and as such, this premeditated brouhaha by the EFCC seems to veer into a caricature and witch-hunting which is a mockery of Nigeria’s judicial due process.
“The former governor was one of the leading performing governors in Nigeria, as he had profound achievements in agriculture, health, education, infrastructure, commerce and trade, security, employment rate, civil service as well as state economy.
“Anambra ranked lowest in poverty index, the unemployment rate dropped drastically, three  jumbo rice mills were established in different parts of the state, 17 iconic bridges and flyovers were constructed with numerous standard roads  throughout the state, functional street and traffic lights were mounted on all roads, built the first Anambra Airport and so on.”
Edochie added the EFCC facility is not safe—otherwise it would not have been possible to make a video of Obiano, and published it online.
