Kate Henshaw, the Nollywood actress, has taunted government-affiliated persons and prominent Nigerians who she suggested feign fainting in court.
On Monday, the wife of Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), had fainted at the federal high court in Abuja.
She slumped shortly after Emeka Nwite, the trial judge, adjourned Kyari’s case for ruling on his bail application.
Henshaw said the “acting” was so good that she fears they might as well take the job from the actors.
“All these actors fainting upandan want collect work from our hand o,” she wrote via her Twitter handle on Monday.

DCP Kyari was, on March 7, arraigned alongside Sunday J Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba, and John Nuhu who are members of the police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).
The NDLEA had accused the defendants of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55 kilograms.
This is not the first time a government-affiliated personality would be fainting or claim to be ill while being arraigned in court — in situations that the observing public has often dismissed as a hoax to engender lenience and sympathy.
