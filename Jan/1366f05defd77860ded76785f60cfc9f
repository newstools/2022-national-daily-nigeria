“Last last, if you don’t heed to this advice, your fate, destiny and overall wellbeing will be determined by the poorly educated, misinformed and illiterate members of the society,” he wrote.


“Be the change you wish to see! It starts with you! Complaining or insulting people on social media has never and will never work.” he added.
