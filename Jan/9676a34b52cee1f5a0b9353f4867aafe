A lot of us are addicted to our smartphones, according to a recent survey, and it may not be as harmless as it sounds. If you’re someone who simply can’t go to the bathroom without your cell, there are some risks you ought to consider. Not only can it be harmful for our health, but it also impacts our minds and how well we work.
However, here are 3 reasons why you should stop using your smartphones when in the toilet
1) It can spread lots of harmful bacteria to your body
Studies have found serious pathogens on cell phones, including Streptococcus and MRSA. One of the worst places to use your phone is in the restroom. When toilets flush, they spread germs everywhere, which is how phones end up with fecal bacteria like E. coli.
This harmful bacteria is linked to intestinal problems such as food poisoning, but that’s not the only harmful bacteria you can pick up in the bathroom.
2) It may increase your chance of getting hemorrhoids
Sitting down in the toilet and scrolling your phone is pretty bad for your butt. Prolonged sitting, which can happen if you get very absorbed in your smartphone, can up your risk of hemorrhoids
This likely happens because of the amount of time spent on the toilet where pressure is put on our organs, which go unsupported over the toilet bowl.
3) It can limit our thinking capacity
Cell phones distract many people today even without being in the toilet, therefore it is good for us to give time for ourselves without our phones, and we can do that by switching it off and hanging out with friends if we do so our thinking capacity won’t be limited. But if we continue to use our phone even in the toilet it can limit our ability to explore around the world physically
