There have been different versions of the incident.
Rights activist Eric Dwyse Ikwuagwu said that Chinonso Obasi was killed because he refused to give up his seat for the soldier at a drinking bar on Monday night.
But Chinonso’s relatives said he was shot by the soldiers who came with his colleagues to deal with the dead victim for blocking his way earlier.
While the accounts of the event vary, the casualty report has been uniform: a soldier shot Chnononso in the head, at close range.
“A soldier of the Nigerian Army attached to a very top former military brass killed Mr. Chinonso Obasi, a youth of Amune community, who was resident in Umuahia until his senseless murder yesterday’s evening, the 3rd of January 2022,” the activist wrote on social media.
HRH Eze Chigbu Ikwulagu, the traditional ruler of the community, said the palace will soon come out with a statement.
An official of the Nigerian Army, who confirmed the incident, said it has been reported to the Army headquarters and investigation was on.
Abia police command spokesman Geoffrey Ogbonna said the police is also investigating.
