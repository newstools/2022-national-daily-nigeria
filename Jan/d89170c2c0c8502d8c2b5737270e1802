Maryam Abubakar from Rugar Hanwa, Sabo Gari, and members of her sex ring were busted by the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) late December.
So far, in four visits to the forest, she has pimped many women, including her own daughters and nieces, for the bandits.
She made N20,000  for each supply.
Also arrested was Fatima Jibril, who, with her boyfriend, Muslim Abubakar, both residents of the Sakadadi area in Sabon Gari, has also been supplying women to the bandits.
The ring was exposed when one of the ladies they shipped to the kidnapper den could not return.
Jummai Ibrahim, another lover of the bandits, had a different story, though.
According to her, she submitted herself to the bandits’ kingpin to protect her children and her father from being murdered. The criminals had threatened to kill them when they came to rustle the family’s herd.
The suspects have regretted their entanglement with the bandits.
Addressing a presser, PPRO Frank Mba said some of the women trafficked for sex even ended up as kidnap victims.
He urged communities to support law enforcement agencies by exposing relatives and community members committing crimes.
