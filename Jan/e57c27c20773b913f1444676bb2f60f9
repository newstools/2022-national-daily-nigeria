“As far as we are concerned, Owelle Rochas Okorocha is a bridge builder. A three-time presidential aspirant, he led a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to form the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2013. He is one of the most qualified and competent persons to fly the flag of the party in next year’s election. He is undoubtedly the widely accepted Igbo presidential aspirant across party lines.
“Rochas Okorocha is a successful businessman. As governor of Imo State between 2007 and 2015, he used his entrepreneurial drive and business acumen for the progress of the state. Okorocha believes that a new Nigeria is possible with the restoration of peace, merging of class and a new orientation. That is exactly what he would bring to the table for the industrialization of the country. He will build on the numerous achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari.”
