He first made headlines in March 2021 when he surgically deballed himself. It was a near-fatal attempt for the drop-out medical student.
He bled so much he ended up in ER.
Anongo, 44, however reached for the second ball again last Monday.
He told newsmen on Sunday January 9;
“I went to remove the second testicle based on religious belief,” he said.
I removed it on Monday. The first one had little hitches but this one having learnt from that experience, I did (remove) it very well.”
Anongo dropped out of surgery and medicine at the University Ibadan years ago. He said he had health problem then.
Bt his faith has made him defy even greater health issues. And he’s OK.
“There is no problem, I’m only waiting for when the wound will heal so I can remove the stitches.”
