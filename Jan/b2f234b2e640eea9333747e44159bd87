And he bragged he will give Tinubu a run for his money during the APC presidential primary, though he said he had no problem with Tinubu’s ambition..
According to Kalu in an interview Tuesday, he has all that it takes to match Tinubu “grit for grit and campaign for campaign if need be for the APC ticket in 2023.
The spoiler alert Senate chief whip shot, however is: If the APC zone the ticket to the south.
He said the South East is ripe for the Presidency and that it should be the turn of the region to produce the next President that should be him.
Many considered Kalu’s posturing as irrelevant.
Both he and Tinubu are from the south, and waiting for the party to hand it over to the southeast is a lame excuse.
Besides, he didn’t position himself this strongly when Tinubu consulted him last year.
