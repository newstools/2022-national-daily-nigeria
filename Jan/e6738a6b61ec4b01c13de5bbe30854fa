The Lagos State House of Assembly Committee on Wealth Creation says no fewer than 1,000 youths will be trained at the one-stop leather hub in Lagos.
Mr Jude Idimogu, Committee Chair and All Progressives member (APC) representing Oshodi-Isolo Constituency II in assembly, disclosed this in an interview with the Newsmen on Monday in Lagos.
According to him, the industrial leather hub will boost employment, create a conducive working space, access to modern equipment for artisans.
“The idea is to have a one-stop shop where people can learn and improve on their skills.
“The hub I believe will accommodate no fewer than 1000 youths to kick-start it when it will be completed to commence operation.
“The industrial hub is over 50 per cent completed, hopefully by May or June, it should be completed for them to showcase their wares, materials are there for use.
“The hub domiciled at Matori area of Mushin in Lagos will take more and other social activities will also take place.
“Youths, who are interested in leather business or fabrics, can come and showcase talents as a way of creating job for themselves,” Idimogu said.
He commended the effort of Gov. Babajide SanwoOlu for having the youth in mind as well as efforts to have the best youths in the state.
He said the state also organised the graduate internship programme to assist them to become employable in the state and the country at large.
Idimogu advised youths to shun crimes and criminality, stay away from vices and be useful to the country in order to contribute to the country’s GDP.
“Lagos State has been organising graduate internship programmes where lots of them are employed and pay stipends.
“I believe the programme will continue to keep them busy and also to have the best youths in the state.
