Adamu Garba said that El-rufai is aware that, that is not a better path for the development of the country but he is constrained by the circumstances at hand. Adamu Garba spoke further by saying that our new generation disagrees. He said the new generation does not believe that a president should be made by geography, he said the new generation believes that the president should be for all Nigerians.
In conclusion, Adamu Garba said that a Nigerian, not a southerner or northerner, not a Muslim or Christian should emerge for the first time. Adamu Garba said he will support a Nigerian president in 2023, he said he is sure that El-rufai will support him later.
