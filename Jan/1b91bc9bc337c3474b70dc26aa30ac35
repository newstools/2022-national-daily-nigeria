Former Chelsea striker, Diego Costa’s contract with Atletico Mineiro has been terminated by mutual consent.
This was disclosed by respected football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, via his Twitter handle on Friday.
Romano Tweeted: “Diego Costa has reached an agreement with Atletico Mineiro to terminate his contract and part ways with immediate effect.
“Former Chelsea and Atletico Madrid striker’s gonna be now available on a free transfer.”
Recall that Costa’s contract with Atletico Madrid was terminated in December 2020, before he signed for Atletico Mineiro on a free transfer in August 2021.
Costa rejoined Atletico Madrid from Chelsea on a permanent three-and-a-half-year contract in January 2018 but left Diego Simeone’s side six months before the end of the agreement.
The Spain international, who switched international allegiance from Brazil in 2014, cited personal reasons for wanting to leave the LaLiga champions following a turbulent second spell at the Wanda Metropolitano that included him being handed an eight-match ban for insulting a referee.
The 33-year-old won five trophies in his first stint on Atletico’s books, including the LaLiga title and Copa del Rey, before being snapped up by Chelsea for £32 million in 2014.
