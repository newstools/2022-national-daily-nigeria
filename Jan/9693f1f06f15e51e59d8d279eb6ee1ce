The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in fresh data released at the weekend shows that a total of 1,071,856 reports of adverse events following COVID vaccines were submitted between Dec. 14, 2020, and Jan. 21, 2022, to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.
The data included a total of 22,607 reports of deaths — an increase of 414 over the previous week — and 178,994 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period — up 4,130 compared with the previous week.
Excluding “foreign reports” to VAERS, 740,000 adverse events, including 10,316 deaths and 67,496 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and Jan. 21, 2022.

Of the 10,316 U.S. deaths reported as of Jan. 21, 19% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 24% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 61% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.
Every Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.
The most recent death involves a 7-year-old girl from Minnesota who died 11 days after receiving her first dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine when she was found unresponsive by her mother. An autopsy is pending.
54% of those who died were male, 41% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased. The average age of death was 72.7.

As of Jan. 21, 4,925 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,575 reports of miscarriage or premature birth. Of the 3,474 cases of Bell’s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 41% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.
850 reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), with 41% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 28% to J&J. 2,281 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.
White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday said the COVID vaccine regime for kids younger than 4 years old will likely include three doses when it’s authorized because two shots did not induce an adequate immune response in 2- to 4-year-olds in Pfizer’s clinical trials.
