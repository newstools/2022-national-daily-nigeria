Manchester United failed to start the new year on a bright note as they lost their first game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English Premier League on Monday evening.
A lone strike from Portuguese international Joao Moutinho very late in the game gave the visitors the deserved win over the Red Devils.
Manchester United was unable to cope with the pressure from Bruno Lage’s side. Wolves were the better team in the game as they created more and also had more shots on targets.
Here are the three players to blame for Manchester United’s loss against Wolves;
1 Aaron Wan-Bissaka
The former Crystal Palace defender was poor in the right fullback position and he didn’t offer a lot going forward. His delivery on the right side when United attacked was woeful and couldn’t create chances for the two strikers.
2 Jadon Sancho
The England international had a poor outing today, and it was unlike his performance against Burnley the last time out. He lost possession on numerous occasions and was substituted later in the game.
3 Scott McTominay
A lot of Manchester United fans would want to blame Phil Jones for the goal scored by the Wolves, but the actual player at fault for that goal was McTominay. The Scottish midfielder was not in a position to stop Moutinho from getting all the whole time in the world to direct his shot into the net.
He also gave away numerous fouls in the game.
