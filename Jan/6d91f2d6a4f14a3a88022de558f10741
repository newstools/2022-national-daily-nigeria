Senator Abiodun Olujimi had earlier withdrawn from the race, claiming that the process was not credible.
The lawmaker representing Ekiti South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, cited gender bias and an unfair resolution of matters arising from a lingering controversial congress of the party.
