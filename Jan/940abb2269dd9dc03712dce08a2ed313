Okon urges Nigerians to get their PVC,  and vote against Tinubu and put an end to bad governance in Nigeria. 
Comedian and actor, Imeh Okon aka Okon Lagos, has reacted to the video of the Director-General of Bola Tinubu Support Management Council, Abdulmumin Jibrin, dismissing questions about the presidential hopeful’s source of income and his age.




The National Daily reports that Jibrin was on AriseTV a few days ago where he was asked about the source of wealth of Bola Tinubu and his real age. Jibrin dismissed the question, arguing that emphasis should be on what Tinubu has achieved, how he turned around the revenue of Lagos and infrastructural development.


Reacting to Jibrin’s position, Okon Lagos was of the opinion that Nigerians should get their PVCs and not settle for any “recycled political ancestor that has past his prime.” Read his post below.
