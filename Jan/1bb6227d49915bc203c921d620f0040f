A former Nigerian High Commissioner to Ghana, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, on Sunday hinted of the possibility of seeking to contest the next governorship election in the Lagos State.


Obanikoro said at his current age, this might be his last opportunity to seek the mandate of Lagos residents to be the chief executive of Nigeria’s commercial and entertainment capital.
Obanikoro had made three attempts at becoming the governor in the past without success.
A former Commissioner for Home Affairs, former Senator and ambassador, Obanikoro said he has paid his dues in politics.
Speaking on AriseTV Sunday, he said the experience acquired over the years must be put to some good use for the state of Lagos.
“I have a right to be a governor in this state. I am eminently qualified,” he declared.
