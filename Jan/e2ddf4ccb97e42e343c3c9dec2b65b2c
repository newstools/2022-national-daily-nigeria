There is emerging fresh plot to frustrate the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February. Some APC members, in fresh plot, approached the court to stop the APC national convention for the election of members of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) in February.
The APC members approached the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja seeking an order to restrain the party’s Caretaker-Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mala Buni of Yobe State from holding the national convention as scheduled. They argued that state congresses are yet to be concluded in all the 36 states of the federation.
The APC members in the suit identified the APC, Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as defendants.
The Federal High Court, Abuja, has not yet fixed a date for hearing of the suit.
The APC state congresses were affected by lingering conflicts in various states, causing set back in about 13 states; in some of the states, previous conflicts over the ward and local government congresses were carried over to the state congresses.
