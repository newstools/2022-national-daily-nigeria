Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has begun a  subtle campaign for a second tenure, though, pushing the decision to residents of the state.  The governor had on Friday stated that his administration has done very well to deserve a second tenure, saying that the people of Lagos State are aware of what they will miss if people fail to return his administration for a second tenure in 2023.
According to Sanwo-Olu, “I think we are doing a very good job.
“If I dare say so, I think that the citizens know what it is they will be missing if they don’t let us continue to wrap up all the things we are doing.”
 “As we speak, we have done about two-thirds of our time – about 65.7 per cent, because we count it every day.
“The field is not open yet; the race has not been declared open yet. But for me, it is about ensuring that these four years that I have promised my citizens, I put every bit of my sweat into it.
“I will ask, I will consult; citizens, how do you see it? …. that’s how you get it down. “Keep your focus on, try and finish very strong. You know when it is time for us to do all the politicking, we will do it.”
Meanwhile, Sanwo-Olu has not formally declared for a second term.
