This is a traditional method which has been used in Chinese alternative medicine for years. According to Chinese experts, this method is 100% effective and can save someone`s life when having a stroke. Chinese professor says that a needle can save a person`s life when having a stroke, and therefore it is recommended that you always have a needle in your house.
Here are the instructions:
First you need to know is that you must not move the person who has just experienced a stroke. It is much better to use a medical needle. In case you don`t have such at home, you can use a simple needle.

If you use an ordinary needle, you must first sterilize it, heat it on a fire, with a lighter or a candle before use. Prick the tips of all 10 fingers as close to the nails as possible and as fast as possible.
The blood will soon start flowing. If this does not happen, squeeze the fingers to simulate it.
As soon as the blood starts flowing out of all the fingers, the person will regain consciousness.
If the mouth of the patient is deformed, massage his ears until they become red in order to improve blood circulation.
Next, prick twice the soft part of the earlobe until you see two drops of blood.
The patient`s mouth will return into normal after a couple of minutes.

It is recommended that you wait until he is completely conscious and then take him to the ER right away.
