The show was scheduled to take place on January 31 but has been postponed to a future date, The Recording Academy and CBS said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
“After careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners, the Recording Academy and CBS have postponed the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards Show,” the statement said.
“The health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly to produce our show remains our top priority. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, holding the show on January 31 simply contains too many risks.”
Nominations for the awards were announced on November 23 and were chosen from projects released between September 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021.
Jon Batiste leads the pack with 11 total nominations, with Justin Bieber and R&B artist H.E.R tying in second with eight nominations. Rapper Jay-Z became the most nominated artist in the show’s history, with 83 nods, after getting three nominations.
