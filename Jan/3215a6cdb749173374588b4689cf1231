The spokesman of the group, Emmanuel Yawe, said the highest office in Nigeria is a serious one, and no oe with a weak medical history should be allowed in there again.
“If people have issues or evidence about his (Tinubu) health, let them come out and speak. Let them provide evidence that he is not strong enough to contest for the Presidency or hold the office,” Yawe said in a press statement.
Tinubu spent months in the UK last year fixing a bad knee, and that coupled with his age (69) makes his critics suspicious his tenure may run like the late President Umar Yar Adua or President Muhammadu Buhari.
“The people who have the evidence that Tinubu is not strong enough for the office of Presidency should save us the agony of having a sick President in office. They should speak out.”
According to him, if Nigerians know that somebody is sick, they  should not allow him to take over that office.
“It is a serious office that will determine the future of millions of citizens. In a complex country like Nigeria, we should not allow somebody that is not medically fit to occupy such an office and mess all of us up.”
Tinubu has declared his intention to succeed Buhari in 2023. The former Lagos governor said it’s his long-harboured ambition.
