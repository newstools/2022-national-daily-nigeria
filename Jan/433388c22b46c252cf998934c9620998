Fashola made the claims in Kano during while he defended the ruling APC on Thursday.
“I can assure you that the present APC administration of President Buhari has achieved what even the US government is trying to do in terms of infrastructure,” he said.
“As of December 2021, we have completed no fewer than 941 kilometres of roads across all states and geopolitical zones in the country.
“For instance, in Kano State here, there are 21 road projects either in, around or in the neighbouring communities by this administration.
“Before APC administration, when last do you remember the Federal Government completing even a 50-kilometre road in any part of Nigeria?
“So, this is the positive change we promised Nigerians in 2015 and it is already happening. They say we are the same as them, but we are not. They stole money and took it abroad, but we are taking this money back and investing it in the area of infrastructure”.
According to him about 850 more projects including bridges, roads and houses are still ongoing.
