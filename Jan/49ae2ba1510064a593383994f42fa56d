Mohammed described the condition as unacceptable during a meeting with the Nigerian community in Cairo.
The  meeting was on the sideline of a bilateral discussion with Africa Export Import Bank (Afreximbank) on how Nigeria can access funding to support its growing creative industry.
Mohammed had led some private sector stakeholders involved in Digital Switch Over (DSO) to Afreximbank to assist them on how they can source fund to complete the wholly private sector financially driven project.
