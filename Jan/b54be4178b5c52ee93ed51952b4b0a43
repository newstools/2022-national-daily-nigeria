Share this on WhatsAppSpread the lovePresident Muhammadu Buhari political adviser has declared his intention to never support APC national leader Bola Tinubu contesting the party’s primary.
Babafemi Ojudu said those accusing him of betraying Tinubu are kidding.
“The idea that everyone who has related with Tinubu and disagrees with him on this presidential bid is a traitor and a betrayal is puerile,” he said in article responding to those he called blackmailers.
“Many of us, his associates, were not made by him as you also want the world to believe.”
The former senator said he wished Tinubu well in his ambition.
“But I cannot in good conscience give him my support or cast my vote for him in the coming primary. It is my right,’ he said dropping his age 60 plus for emphasis.
“Let no one think he can browbeat or blackmail me to do what does not go with my conscience or my ideals. Enough of your phone threats and the embarrassment of my family members,” he said.
H said he knows Tinubu, and he respects and adores him—much more than many of Tinubu’s ‘latter-day’ supporters.
“When Tinubu decided to go against Afenifere and the Yoruba elders in 2003 by not supporting President Olusegun Obasanjo, he wasn’t betraying the Yoruba nation or a traitor to Afenifere. He made a choice and history has been his judge.
“Let history be my own judge too.
“When he supported Chief Olu Falae against Chief Bola Ige, our respected leader, who fought for him to emerge as the candidate of Alliance for Democracy in Lagos, no one shouted betrayal,” he said.
Ojodu has been managing V.P. Yemi Osinbajo’s media office for a while now, clarifying what many see as the frosty relationship between Tinubu and his godson Osinbajo.
The coldness is becoming freezing as Tinubu one-upped Osinbajo and other likely contestants by first declaring his presidential ambition last week.
