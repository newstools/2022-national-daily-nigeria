According to the commission Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee Festus Okoye said the body will process the applications, despite deregistering 74 parties two years ago.
“Sections 221 to 229 of the constitution lay down the threshold for the registration of political associations,” he told the Daily Trust.
“The commission is under a constitutional and legal obligation to register political associations that meet the qualifying threshold. The commission does not exercise authoritarian discretion in the registration of political parties.
“The Constitution, the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and the Regulations and Guidelines of the commission remain the guiding instruments and documents for party registration. Any political association that meets the constitutional, legal and administrative criteria set out in the constitutive legal instruments will be registered.
“Any registered political party that falls off the radar of the threshold in Section 225A of the constitution will be deregistered. The commission is a public trust and its actions and activities are governed by the constitution and the law,” he said.
