Bread and tea is a food combination many people love but very few know how detrimental it can be to their health. This becomes worse if you have an existing case of any health challenge.
Research has shown that certain medical conditions make consuming bread and tea hazardous. This is mainly because bread is a processed food made with white flour, sugar and salt. And tea is also made with sugar and artificial sweeteners. That is why their Intake should be limited in certain cases.
Some of the health conditions that might warrant you to limit bread and tea intake include;
1. High blood pressure
High blood pressure is one of the health conditions that might get worsened when you consume bread and tea. This is because tea ingestion can cause a large acute increase in blood pressure than caffeine alone. Bread can also worsen this condition since it is made with processed flour.
2. Diabetes
Diabetes is also another health condition that can be worsened by bread and tea intake. Carbohydrates foods such as bread turn into glucose in your body hence, they affect your blood glucose level more than other foods do. Tea can also trigger insulin sensitivity hence reduce your intake of it if you have diabetes.
3. Stomach ulcer
Drinking tea can irritate sores in the lining of the stomach. This is because it is acidic and can increase stomach acid. Despite the effects of some food on ulcers might not be severe, giving up caffeine, tea, bread, etc might help.
