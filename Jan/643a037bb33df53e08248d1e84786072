This mother ‘forgot’ her baby in a commercial bus while alighting in Imo state and efforts are currently being made to find the child’s mother.
The driver of the bus said he picked up passengers from Ogbaku to Owerri, but when he got to Owerri, after all the passengers had alighted, the baby was left in his vehicle.
He took the baby to a media personality to make an announcement so that the mother or anyone who knows the baby can come and pick the child up.
There are is still hope in humanity.
