The United States Embassy in Nigeria has announced the resumption of the drop box service or interview waiver in Nigeria.
The Drop Box visa renewal programme allows certain visa applicants who have previously been issued U.S. visas to renew their visas without attending an interview.
Nigeria was removed from the waiver eligibility in 2018.
However, according to a recent announcement, to qualify for the interview waiver, visa applicants must be applying to renew either a B1/B2, an F, an L, or an H visa.
They must satisfy all of the criteria for their visa class.
If applying as a group or family, all members must fulfill each criteria to use the programme.
Applicants who are 79 years and older automatically qualify for the interview waiver although they are still required to apply and print a copy of their interview waiver letter through the schedule platform.
