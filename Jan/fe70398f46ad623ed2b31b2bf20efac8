Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu is still getting a lot of knocks for his seemingly cold and lukewarm demeanour during his recent exchange with a CSP at Magodo, Lagos.
The governor who is supposed to be the chief security officer of the state was locked in a stalemate with a Police CSP who refused to yield to the governor’s demands. The disturbing incidence was captured on video and has since gone viral on social media with many Lagosians disappointed with the governor.
In his reaction, Nigerian musician and producer, Samklef Tweeted, ‘the 1st errand governor in the history of Government in Nigeria. What’s his name?’.
