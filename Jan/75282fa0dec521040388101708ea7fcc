A group pushing for the empowerment of youths in the Niger Delta, has urged the Presidency to role out programmes that will revitalize the economy in 2022.

The group under the aegis of the Ogoni Liberation Initiatives (OLI), said only a revamped economy will end insecurity, banditry and other societal ills ravaging the country.

President of the group, Dr. Fabeke Douglas in his New Year message Saturday, also called on Nigerians to continue to demonstrate the principles of oneness and togetherness and fight hard to resist efforts to cause disunity or disharmony in the country.


According to him, “The year 2021 was without a doubt one of the most challenging years in living memory not only in Nigeria but indeed across the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic”, he said.
Fabeke also commended individuals, corporate organizations, government agencies and non-governmental organizations who, despite the challenging times, has continued to provide palliatives and other forms of support to the more vulnerable members of the society.
He also lauded the Nigerian President, Mohammadu Buhari, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo and the Federal Executive Council for their tireless efforts in ensuring that the country remain together.
“I wish the Presidency and the entire Nigerians, a prosperous New Year”, he said.
