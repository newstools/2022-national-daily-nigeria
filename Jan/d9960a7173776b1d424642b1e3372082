The Atiku Abubakar technical committee led by High Chief Raymond Dokepesi, taking its consultation to the Government House, Yola, Adamawa State, covertly instigated members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to oppose zoning the party’s presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections. The technical committee incited PDP members in the northeast to resist any party arrangement towards imposing a candidate on the people through zoning. Members of the committee declared that the northeast region must be given the opportunity to produce the next president in 2023.
The Atiku Abubakar technical committee led by High Chief Dokepesi has been on a consultative movement across the country mobilizing support for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar for the PDP ticket for the 2023 general elections.
The Deputy Governor of Adamawa State, Crowther Seth, as well as  the PDP State Chairman, Tahir Shehu, were of the view that the reception accorded the committee delegation was a reflection of the support of Adamawa State, the ancestral home of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, for his presidential aspiration.
Various PDP stakeholders in the state declared their unalloyed support for the former vice president.
There have been demands for rotation of the president to the south in 2023. In spite of the demands, Atiku has sustained his campaign for the 2023 presidential ticket of the PDP.
