Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara, has been suspended by the Emirate Council of Bauchi State, and restrained from performing any role assigned to his traditional tittle of the Jakadaniyan of Bauchi.
The Emirates Council in a statement by Galadiman Bauchi, Ibrahim Saidu Jahun, and the Council Secretary, Shehu Mudi Mohammed, indicated that the former Speaker was suspended after consideration at the Council’s meeting of the attack on the Emir of Bauchi and Emir of Bogoro during the Tafawa Balewa violence.
The Emirate Council was enraged with Dogara, a traditional title holder in the Emirate, who was found to have misled the people during the incident.
The Council complained that Dogara did not show sympathy or any sign of remorse towards what happened to the two Emirs.
The Council declared that Dogara, was therefore, suspended as JAKADIYAN Bauchi until the determination of the case before the Bauchi State High Court between the Bauchi State Government, Dogara and 28 others on 11 count criminal charges.
