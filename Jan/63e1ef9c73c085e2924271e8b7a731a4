The Governor of Jigawa state, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, has said that Nigerian governors no longer use convoys of 30 to 40 vehicles because they are trying to cut costs in governance.
Speaking during an interview on Channels Television which aired on Monday night, January 17, the northern governor said his colleagues didn’t want to spend public funds unnecessarily.
“All the governors try to look inwards on their spendings. You don’t see governors going in a convoy of 30, 40 vehicles. You see us mostly now with three or four vehicles,” he said.
“Most of the governors have dropped unnecessary expenditure to reduce the cost of governance. That is the first step to reduce the cost of governance.”
He then added that state governors are prioritising employment in the education and health sectors.
