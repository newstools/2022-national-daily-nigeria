Samuel Tagher Nyitor succumbed to death on Sunday from the disease after being referred to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo State from Benue.
The fever killed two of his patents he treated last week.
Joseph Ngbea, commissioner of health and human resources, however confirmed to journalists in Makurdi on Monday that only the doctor that was taken to Irrua died.
“One doctor died. Nobody else is in critical condition. The other person there (BSUTH) is very stable.
“Before the Lassa Fever outbreak, the ministry through the governor released money so even when they made the diagnosis, we wanted to take over the payment but the hospital said no, they will be the one to pay.
“As we speak, they have released the purchase of drugs worth N600,000. Anybody that had contact with him (deceased) should make themselves available at the teaching hospital,” he said.
He advised citizens to keep away anything that will encourage the hosts of the fever—rats.
