Nemesis caught up with the worker of a farm in Ijare, Ogun State who stole eight crates of eggs at a-go overnight.

According to reports gathered from a video shared on the internet, the culprit was caught in the process of carting away eight crates of eggs estimated to be worth roughly N15K.
An act which he must have been carrying out for years of his employment on the farm.
One of the management’s representatives who caught him could be heard lamenting how the farm had multiple low turnouts over the years.
