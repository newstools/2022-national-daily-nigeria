There is a chance that antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS could have negative side effects. Following the end of antiretroviral treatment, scientists explain how HIV patients can keep their viral levels down (ART).
All people who have HIV should get antiretroviral treatment (ART) to help them get better (HIV). Take a mix of antiretroviral drugs every day for the rest of your life to keep the virus from spreading to other parts of your body.
If HIV isn’t treated, it could lead to a lot of bad things, like illness, if it isn’t.
About HIV treatment, most people think antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the best thing you can do for your health. The fact that people have to take a long-term drug makes them feel ashamed, long-term consequences, and give the virus a chance to become resistant to the drug.

Positive people who have HIV should be happier when they learn new things: People who work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have come up with two ways to help HIV patients keep track of their progress after they stop taking antiretroviral drugs.
People who have HIV may never need to find a solution for the rest of their lives because of this.

It was led by Dr. Tae-Wook Chun, the head of the HIV Immunovirology Section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the NIAID and the Laboratory of Immunoregulation, who both work at the NIAID.
The effects of stopping antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people who have HIV aren’t clear, but they could be bad.
In the study, two people with HIV took antiretroviral drugs (ART) under the supervision of a clinically trained professional. After they were infected, they started taking the drugs right away and kept taking them for more than six years, effectively killing HIV.
