Romelu Lukaku has apologised to Chelsea supporters for the interview in which he expressed his unhappiness at Stamford Bridge.


The Belgian striker was dropped for Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Liverpool with Blues boss Thomas Tuchel claiming the situation had become “too big, too noisy”.


However, in a video released by the West Londoners, Lukaku has now apologised to Chelsea fans and explained comments made in the interview with Sky Sports Italia, which was filmed three weeks ago.


Lukaku said: “It’s been quite a few hectic days I think, everybody can understand why.


“It’s been tough weeks personally too with Covid, trying to get back into the team but in the end, the last two games I’ve tried to help the team win.


“I totally understand, I think I should have been much clearer in my message.


“The interview was about saying goodbye to the Inter fans, it was not about trying to disrespect the fans, the football club, the owner, my teammates and the manager.


“They did a lot of effort to bring me back here and I was on a mission ever since I left.


“I totally understand the frustrations of the fans but it’s up to me to show my commitment is 100% and I will.”


Lukaku, 28, had said he was unhappy at Stamford Bridge owing to a lack of minutes while citing a change in formation as part of the problem.


The former Inter Milan striker also outlined his intention to rejoin the Nerazzurri while still in his prime — despite moving to Stamford Bridge for a club-record £97.5million deal in August.


A combination of injuries and Covid-19 have limited Lukaku to just eight Premier League starts and five goals in his second spell with Chelsea.
