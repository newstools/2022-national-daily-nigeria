Shuaibu said Kanu “vehemently” denied being a member of the proscribed pro-Biafra group.
“One of the charges suggested that the defendant, Nnamdi Kanu is a member of IPOB and he vehemently denied being a member of IPOB,” the government lawyer said after Wednesday hearing of fresh charges the government filed afresh against Kanu.
“That is very curious and we urge Nigerians to see us through how we are going to prove all those charges against the defendant in no time to come.”
Kanu has pleaded not guilty to the charges when read to him.
Binta Nyako, the judge, fixed February 16 to hear an application by the defendant challenging the propriety of his trial as well as competence of the charge against him.
IPOB was proscribed in 2017, and its members are designated as outlaws.
The separatist leader jumped bail during his trial sae year, bu was rearrested in Kenya last year to continue his trial while he remains in DSS detention.
