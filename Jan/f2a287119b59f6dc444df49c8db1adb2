The Rivers chief security officer wants more.
“He must leave this State. I can’t be Governor here and a security man owns an illegal refinery. No, it is not possible…the man has to go. Take him to wherever they allow bunkering,” Wike said on Friday during a meeting with council chairmen .
The PDP governor also hit heads of other security agencies, including the army, navy, air force, DSS, and others he alleged are aiding illegal oil business in the state.
He ordered all the security agents in charge of vandalism to be redeployed too.
“It’s unfortunate for this country how security people will be involved in illegal bunkering. I can’t believe it,” he said.
Rivers has been enveloped in soot for days now. Environment watchers believe it part of the damaging effect of illegal fossil fuel operations rampant in the state.
Wike told all the council chairmen to provide a list of illegal refineries in their domain.
