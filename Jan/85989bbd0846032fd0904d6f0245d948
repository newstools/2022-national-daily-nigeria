The national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has gone to talk or meet with President Muhammadu Buhari again. The leader met with the president in October, 2021, the Punch Newspaper reported. His presence in the Presidential Villa is now more significant than ever.
There have been a lot of rumours about the relationship between Mr. President and his ally. There were unconfirmed reports that former president Goodluck Jonathan may join the APC all in order to clinch the ticket of the party. There were also reports that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has informed the president about his own ambition.
When Tinubu met with the Northern Alliance Committee, he said he wouldn’t want to distract the president for now. He further claimed that he would have a word with his associates before taking decision about the 2023 elections.

With his presence in the Presidential Villa now, he can ask the president to grant endorsement for his own presidency. Note that Buhari remains the head of the APC. And no matter what Tinubu wants to do, he will carry Muhammadu Buhari along.
From another perspective, the president granted an interview to the Channels Television few days ago. He talked about so many sundry issues. And he was asked about the 2023 presidential election. Of course, the president couldn’t be expected to just make a pronouncement on the television like that.
Tinubu can use his presence at the presidential villa right now to make inquiry from the president about the anointed candidate. Many Nigerians would expect the president to pay back Tinubu for his activeness in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.
The former Lagos State governor can ask the president to be sincere with him. If Buhari prefers Tinubu to other aspirants, the former governor can know. Surely, it is a private meeting, yet Tinubu can know his position in the scale of preference of the president.
