The United Arab Emirates (UAE) says it will resume passenger flights from 12 African countries, including Nigeria, from Saturday, January 29.
The UAE’s National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority (NCEMA) announced this in a Twitter post on Wednesday.
“From January 29, entry into the UAE for arrivals from Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, the Republic of South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe is allowed again,” the tweet reads.
According to the statement, entry procedures have been updated for flights originating from Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda.
It added that passengers arriving from these three countries to the UAE must have a negative COVID-19 test obtained within 48 hours of departure from the approved labs in their respective countries.

The UAE authority said passengers must undergo a Rapid PCR test at the airports of departure. On arrival in the UAE, they will be subjected to another PCR test.
The Arab nation asked residents of African countries to refrain from traveling to the country if they have COVID-19 symptoms.
Travel restrictions were put in place in December by the Arab country over the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Emirates Airline, the flag carrier of the UAE, had also suspended flights to several African nations as a result of the directive.
Last two weeks, the airline resumed flights from five African countries — excluding Nigeria.
