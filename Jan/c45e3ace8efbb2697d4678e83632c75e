Three robbery suspects were arrested on Tuesday night in the Agege area of Lagos State, the Lagos Rapid Response Squad has said.
The suspects had attacked a pedestrian, Yusuph Ahmed, smashed a bottle on his head and dispossessed him of N100,000, three mobile phones and a wristwatch.
The suspects; Ridwan Imran (20), Lukman Abiodun (18) and Abdulahi Isa (18) were reported to have approached their victim and demanded a raise before eventually chasing him and robbing him of his belongings.
The suspects by Lukman Abiodun in the company of four others, some of them still at large, had approached the complainant at about 9pm and the victim had explained that he had no money.
“The suspects harassed and chased him to Agege Stadium, smashed a bottled on his head, pushed him inside the drainage and dispossessed him of a hundred thousand naira, three mobile phones and a wristwatch all estimated at over N600,000,” the Squad said in a statement titled, ‘RRS Arrests Three In Agege For Robbery’.
The statement read in part, “The Commander, Rapid Response Squad, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, who intercepted a distress call from the area about traffic robbery, directed the Decoy Team to the scene where three of the principal suspects were chased and arrested while others escaped.
“Preliminary investigations by the team resulted in the recovery of one of the victim’s three mobile phones from where it was hidden.”
