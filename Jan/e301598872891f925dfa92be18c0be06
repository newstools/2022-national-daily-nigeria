Popular Nollywood actress and producer, Toyin Abraham has opened up on life challenges, noting that at a time, she contemplated suicide.
Recounting her experience, Toyin revealed that being depressed made her abandon her family and led her into smoking cigarettes which is unacceptable in her Christian home.
“It was so bad that I thought of swimming or jumping from the third mainland bridge and hoping someone will save me. I confided in people and they used it against me, I had fear of the unknown, my thoughts were filled with negative things.
The 39-year-old actress said, “At some time in my life my manager had to get me a counselor because I was depressed but lived in denial. I was not happy and very scared of life.

“It was hard for me to trust people then because the people I had around me didn’t know how to keep things secret. I am from a Christian home but had to avoid them because I started smoking cigarettes.
“I detached myself from my family because I thought I was going to die soon and didn’t want them to miss me.”
She, however, took responsibility for her life after she got a new manager and a counselor and has since continued to soar higher in her life and career.
“I had to change everybody around me, had a different mentality to rediscover myself.
“When you’re depressed you don’t know what you’re capable of doing, immediately I overcame all of that, I redesigned my life to be my best version.
“I got over my fears with the help of my manager and counselor. You have to go through fire to have the finest things,” the actress concluded.
