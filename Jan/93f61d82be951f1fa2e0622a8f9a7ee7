The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at its mega rally at the Cenotaph, Asaba, last Saturday, harvested a multitude of defectors from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State.
Governor Ifeanyi Okowa had assured that the PDP in Delta State is one united family.
The PDP State Chairman, Chief Kingsley Esiso, received the defectors from the APC, disclosing that the purpose of the mega rally was to welcome APC defectors, including other parties.
The State Chairman stated that the mass exodus from the APC was a testimony that the ruling party has failed Nigerians in all ramifications, adding that PDP will deplete 90% of APC members in Delta State.
Esiso highlighted: “I can tell you that the primary purpose of this rally is to reduce the opposition party in Delta State by 90%.
“My heart is full of joy and a testimony that APC is a failed political party and the people of Delta have come to realise that APC has only come to bring us economic hardship, poverty, banditry, kidnapping and failed promises.
“It is, therefore, not a surprise that every reasonable member of the APC is jumping ship to join us.
“Today, we are harvesting many of their leaders from different local government areas and we are celebrating this victory for our great party.”
The former APC State Chairman in Delta State, Cyril Ogodo, led the multitude of APC defectors to PDP at the mega rally. Ogodo promised to collaborate with the PDP to ensure the extinction of APC in the state.
Deputy Governor Kingsley Otuaro assured Deltans continuous service delivery by the Okowa administration in the state. The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu; Senator James Manager, representing Delta South in the National Assembly; former Chief Whip of the Senate, Stella Omu, participated in the mega rally.
