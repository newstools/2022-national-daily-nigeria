Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a front line presidential aspirant for the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 presidential race on Monday renewed his promise to serve for one term in office and handover to the younger generation. The head of the Atiku Mobilisation team, high Chief Raymond Dokpesi, at a consultative meeting in the southeast with PDP stakeholders on Monday, reaffirmed the assurance of Atiku to serve one term as president of the country and handover to a president from the southeast.
Dokpesi assured the Igbo leaders that PDP leaders are aware they have competent people to be president of Nigeria and  can make impact in solving the problems of the country. Dokpesi also told the Igbo stakeholders that if the southeast had produced the president, the country will develop more than it has done over the years, noting that an Igbo president will industrialize Nigeria.
Dokpesi, however, appealed for southeast support for Atiku in getting the PDP presidential ticket for the 2023 elections, with assurance of inclusive roles for the southeast in the governance of the country under the leadership of Atiku.
