According to him, he recalled the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP won the 2019 presidential election, but the APC rigged the election so badly.
He said they tried to prove to them that they stole the mandate of the PDP but the Supreme Court gave it to the presidential candidate of the APC, Muhammad Buhari. But since then, Nigeria has been in turmoil.
“Since that 2019, our sons and daughters in Katsina State have not known peace. Nobody can sleep with two eyes closed anymore. Bandits, terrorists, different sets of people have been coming to hunt and make life impossible for all of us.” He said.
