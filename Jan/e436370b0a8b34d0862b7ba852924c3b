The group the asked the ruing APC to sack him ahead of the 2023 general election.
In a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Hon. Tobias Ogbeh on Thursday in Abuja, the group accused the DG of surreptitious moves in an open letter he authored to party leaders recently.
Lukman authored the open letter to party leaders without subjecting it through the line of communications, a development considered an attempt to distabilise the APC.
The group described as unfortunate that the DG exploited confusions rocking the planned National Convention of the APC to ply his poisonous ware by pretending to make a legitimate intervention.
“As our Forum struggle to come to terms with the reality that the man who administers the umbrella body of APC governors is a mole within the party and being used by some forces to destroy our organization from inside, we find it pertinent to alert stakeholders to the dangers that the DG’s continued occupation of that office poses to the success of the APC in the months ahead.
“Our concern and resolve in this regard are borne out the realization that aside from acting under inducement from external forces bent on destroying the APC, we have also become aware that Lukman is alleged to have received some dollars to import thugs into Abuja to disrupt the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC)”, the statement said.
