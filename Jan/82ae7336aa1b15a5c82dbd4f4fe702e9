President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered intensive military operations to tame bandits activities in Niger State. The President was identified to have set the ball rolling for a major military operation in Niger State which has faced continued attacks on its communities by bandits and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theaters of war in the Northwestern and Northeastern parts of the country.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President, Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement indicated  that in a directive to the Defence Headquarters a few days ago, the President asked the military to respond robustly to the cases of killings and kidnappings in the State and to give effect to the strategic objectives through the use of force.
President Buhari was cited in his message to the government and people of Niger State, to have said: “I would like to express sincere sympathies to the government and people of the State following recent security incidents.”
The President reiterated that security is a responsibility of every member of the community and only through solidarity and cooperation with law enforcement agencies can we defeat the problems finally.
According to the President, “The Federal Government is willing to strengthen support and cooperation with all the states. I believe that with the full cooperation of the citizens, we will surely overcome this problem.”
