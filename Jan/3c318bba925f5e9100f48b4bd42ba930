The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday denied claims that it has zoned its presidential ticket.
This was contained in a statement by Hon. Debo Ologunagba, National Publicity Secretary of the party.
He described it as completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of PDP.
“For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country,” the statement said.
He said the party was founded on democratic principles, saying that every action of the party, including zoning, is based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation.
He said the party has the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of the nation are reinforced and promoted.
The statement further added that the party urged Nigerians and “our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled, just as it cautioned those behind the claims to desist forthwith.”
The PDP thanked Nigerians for their “overwhelming interest in the party as their sure platform to rescue and rebuild our nation from misrule and urged them to remain united and focused as we join forces for the task ahead.”
