Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, Mai Mala Buni has debunked a list circulating online that the party has zoned its presidential ticket and other national working committee (NWC) offices to various geopolitical zones in the country.
On Tuesday night, a list was circulated on social media which suggested that the APC had zoned its presidential ticket to the south as well as NWC positions to geo-political zones.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mamman Mohammed, Buni’s aide, quoted his principal as describing the list as fake.
Mohammed said the Yobe governor asked the public to disregard, adding that it is “just a figment of the author’s imagination”.
“His Excellency has in clear and unambiguous terms denied the said list, saying it is false, baseless, unfounded, misleading and has nothing to do with him,” he said.

“The chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee, said the party has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to zoning of offices.
“The publication is just a figment of the author’s imagination that has nothing to do with the chairman and the party.
“The public is hereby urged to disregard the purported list as it is misleading and completely false.
“Governor Buni urged the press to resist unverified stories and rumours, and to always verify all issues related to the party, assuring that the doors of the party are always open.”
