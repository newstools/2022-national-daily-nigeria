Squid Game actor, O Yeong-su has become a first-time Golden Globe winner at 77. He was among the winners at the Golden Globes that happened on Sunday, January 9.


At the award, the South Korean actor, who portrayed Oh Il-nam otherwise known as Player 001 in the hit Netflix drama, triumphed in the Best Supporting Actor In A TV Drama category.


He beat Kieran Culkin for Succession, Ted Lasso star Brett Goldstein, and The Morning Show’s Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass to win the award.





At 77, O Yeong-su is now the oldest male actor to ever win a Golden Globe. But he’s still way off being the oldest winner ever, with the late composer Ennio Morricone still holding onto that honor for his Best Score win for The Hateful Eight at 87.


O Yeong-su’s character served as a companion for protagonist Seong Gi-hun in Squid Game, only to end up being at the center of one of the biggest twists of the whole show.





His win was the only victory for Squid Game at this year’s Golden Globes, where it was also nominated for Best TV Drama and Best Performance In A TV Drama for Lee Jung-jae.
