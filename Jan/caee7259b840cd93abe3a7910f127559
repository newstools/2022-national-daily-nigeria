Singer Simi took to her Twitter handle to express her disappointment in the Nigerian government over the state of the affairs of the country.
In her Tweet, the superstar and mum of one wondered why the government failed to see the bigger picture of ensuring that the country works because it is for the collective good of everyone.
She wrote;
”I do not, for the life of me, understand how the government does not see how they, we have so much much much more to gain if they actually fixed the country. Why are they blind to the big picture. How much can you steal? How much can you spend? Why can’t you help your people?
