Nigerian Social-Political Activist and co-convener of ‘Bring Back Our Girls’ movement, Aisha Yesufu, has reacted to the news that a group endorsing the vice President for the 2023 presidency, has said that the EndSARS uprising wouldn’t have seen the light of days if Vice -President Yemi Osibanjo’s handling of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), was not derailed.
According to The cable, the group, known as IdentifytheRightLeader, recently published a 120-page impact assessment report on the vice-president, detailing his activities as former acting president of Nigeria and former attorney general of Lagos State.
According to the report, the EndSARS protests which swept through the nation in October 2020 would not have happened if Osibanjo’s plan to overhaul SARS did not die down when President Buhari returned to the country.
However, Nigerian social-political activist and co-convener of ‘Bring Back Our Girls’ movement, Aisha Yesufu has decided to reply the group through her verified Twitter page, for making such a bold claim.
According to Aisha Yesufu, Vice President Yemi Osibanjo is not a saint because he started the attack on civic spaces when he was Acting President of the country. He continued by stating that the Vice President used armoured tankers and hot water trucks on protesters while he was the acting president of the country.
