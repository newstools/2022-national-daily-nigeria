President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday expressed sadness over the death Ernest Shonekan, Head of Interim National Government. Shonekan died at a hospital in Lagos on Tuesday at the age of 85 years.
President Buhari in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, indicated he received the news of Shonekan’s death with sadness.
The statement reads: “President Buhari believes that Nigeria owes a great debt to Chief Shonekan, the peacemaker, who even at the twilight of his life never stopped believing and working for a prosperous and democratic country,” the statement read.
“The President notes that Chief Shonekan demonstrated to all that the love for country and commitment to her development, peace and unity transcend the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.
“On behalf of the Federal Government, the President extends deepest condolences to Chief Shonekan’s wife, Margaret, loved ones, as well as the government and people of Ogun State.
“As an internationally respected statesman, President Buhari affirms that, with courageous wisdom, Chief Shonekan left his flourishing business career to become the Head of Government, at a delicate time when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking.
“The President prays that the memory of the departed Head of Government will remain a blessing to Nigeria even as he finds perfect peace with Almighty God.”
Shonekan was appointed Head of the Interim National Government by former Head of State, General Ibrahim Babangida, on August 26, 1993, and was overthrown on November 17, 1993, by late General Sani Abacha.
