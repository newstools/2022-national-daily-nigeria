Ahead of the 2023 General Elections, there have been trending political observations that the former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and the incumbent vice president of the country, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, would probably decide to join the presidential race.

Although, neither former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan nor vice president Professor Yemi Osinbajo has made it known to the public that they would be vie for the presidential seat of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023, but the fact remains that despite the sensitivity of the perception, none of former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan or vice president Professor Yemi Osinbajo has, convincingly, denounced their possibility of participating in the much anticipated polls.
However, if by the ways, both former president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and vice president Yemi Osinbajo later decide to join the 2023 presidential race, as being perceived, it will surely have strategic effect on the supports of the northerners for the either candidates.

While some northerners may be seeing Professor Yemi Osibanjo as a gentleman who could, easily, be convinced in the course of playing the likes of northern politics, former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan could be seen as an experienced former president who had, previously held the position, learned his lessons and may not want to be played out, politically, again.
Besides, some northerners may be of the opinion that their supports for former president, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, could be considered as a shortcut to the northerners’ return to power, while their supports for Professor Yemi Osibanjo may delay the proximity of northerner to come back to power to around 2031, considering the ethics of two terms as permitted by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
