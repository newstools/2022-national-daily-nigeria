However, the suspect’s family has claimed that their son is mentally unstable. The suspect’s father, a University lecturer, recently addressed the issue during an interview.
Speaking about his son, Joseph Oko said, “I suspected that my son was smoking weed as I often smelled it. I confronted him about the issue, and he told me that it is better than smoking cigarettes.”
Jennifer’s lifeless body was reportedly found at a hotel in Jos, along Zaria Road, while some of her body parts, including her eyes, are missing.
