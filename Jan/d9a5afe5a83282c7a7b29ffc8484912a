Former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to President Buhari revelation that he is not going to disclose the identity of his preferred presidential candidate in the next general 2023, election due to security reasons.
During an interview on Channels Television aired on Wednesday January 5, 2022, President Buhari said his favourite candidate for the presidency in 2023 will be ‘eliminated’ if he mentions the person’s name.
When asked about his favourite presidential candidate, President Buhari said, “I won’t tell you my favourite for 2023, he may be eliminated if I mention. I better keep it. It is secret.” He said. He continued by stating that he doesn’t care about who succeeds him.
This statement by President Buhari has generated mixed reactions amongst Nigerians. Based on that former senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Shehu Sani has decided to air his opinion through a post that he shared on his verified Twitter page.
According to Senator Shehu Sani, It’s a contradiction for President Buhari to say that he has a preferred candidate but he is keeping it to himself.
“It’s a contradiction to say you have a preferred candidate but keeping it to yourself, and to say you don’t care who succeeds you.” He wrote.
