Following the exclusive interview held by Channels TV with the President of the Federation, Muhammadu Buhari, there have been several reactions from Nigerians on social media concerning several areas touched by the President. Recall that before the interview, the Channels TV hosts had mentioned that some conditions were met before the interview could be granted and a list of questions covering security, economy, corruption, education, electoral bill, among others, were sent beforehand.

Amongst the questions that were thrown to the President was premised on the crisis between the Farmers and the Herders in the Southwest which the president went off-topic while answering. One of the hosts had asked His Excellency if the reduction of the crisis between Farmers and Herders in the past few months could be based on the change in weather conditions. By this, what the host meant was that the Herders might be making their way down to the southern region if the rivers and streams in the North get dried off soon.

While responding to the question, the President stated that the government does not have control of the weather, adding that we only need to pray to God because Nigeria is susceptible to climate change because of its population and size. Noticing that the President has gone off point, the host readdressed her question again and the president gave yet another response.
