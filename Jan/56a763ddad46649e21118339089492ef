President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday sent his heartfelt condolence to the Government and People of Oyo State, the Royal Family, the Olubadan-In-Council and the indigenes of Ibadan on the demise of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji.
The President in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in Abuja, celebrated  the demised royal father a visionary and compassionate leader, who within the jurisdiction of a respected traditional ruler and a lover of the creative industry promoted the progress of his people, encouraging and motivating them to give their best in their vocation and to the nation.
The President, noting that the demise of the royal father understandably leaves a huge void to fill, encouraged the people of Ibadan and Nigerians from different walks of life to honour the eternal memory of the deceased by imbibing the virtues he cherished so much, which include generosity, peace, tolerance, and devotion to unity.
President Buhari expressed that as the funeral rites of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland gets underway in Ibadan, he anticipates that the process of selecting his successor will be guided by wisdom, understanding and good judgment that exemplified the life the demised Olubadan lived.
The President prayed to God to grant the soul of Oba Adetunji eternal rest and comfort the family, friends, associates, and subjects he left behind.
