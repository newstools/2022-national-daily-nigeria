Hellen Vuyanzi, 35, initially wetted the house with petrol, and then lit it.
Her third child, 11, managed to jump through the window before the house exploded.
The incident happened in Sirende Village in Lugari Sub-County, Kakamega County, on New Year’s day, January 1, 2022, after she accused her husband of cheating on her with another woman.
Lugari Sub-County Police Commander, Bernard Ngungu, told The Standard that Vuyanzi had accused her husband of infidelity.
“We had earlier counselled Vuyanzi and her spouse, Thomas Amito, after a domestic dispute arose between them. We understand that Hellen had accused Thomas of cheating on her with another woman.” said Ngungu.
Police say Vuyanzi might have bought petrol from a local filling station, and used it to set her matrimonial home alight.
Vuyanzi and her partner had been having recurrent domestic wrangle.
“The two were quarreling now and again, with the woman accusing her husband of infidelity. We didn’t expect that their issues would end tragically,” a neighbor said.
Stephen Okila, her brother-in-law, said he was not aware of any marital issues that his cousin, Amito, had with his partner.
“I was close to them (Amito and Vuyanzi), and I didn’t hear of any issues with their marriage.” he added.
