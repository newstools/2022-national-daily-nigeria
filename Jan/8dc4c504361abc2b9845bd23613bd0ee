Suleiman Yahaya-Kwande, a former federal lawmaker has admonished the people of his constituents not to allow any politician divide them between religious or ethnic lines.
Kwande who is contesting the Jos North/Bassa Bye-election as fixed by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), on February 26th, raised concern on the campaign of disunity peddled by politicians who sick’s to pitch the people against him with religious coloration.
Recalling his achievements as a former House of Representative member, Kwande said it wasn’t based on religion but centered on the needs of the people, an act which he asked aspirants focus on, as well as emulate.
The former lawmaker spoke on Friday in Jos, while responding to some hate speech being sponsored against him.
His words: “I wish to admonish people in Bassa and Jos North constituency to leverage more on the strength and harmonious relationship that we have built over the years as a Constituent.
“We should channel our energy towards improving the standard of living of our people and build more on the good values and peaceful co-existence that we have laboured for over the years and shun religious, ethic and any form of sentiment that will divide us.
“Leadership comes from God and He gives to anyone he chooses. If God gives me the opportunity to represent my people again, I will use my experience as a former House member to attract more development and push for more people oriented bills that will better the lots of the people”, he said.
