Leading civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has revealed that the organized body of credible civil society platforms-comprising of over 200 groups has endorsed the move by the federal government to set up the NYSC youths Trust Fund.
HURIWA stated that the coalition affirmed that the coming on board of the endowment fund also known as NYSC YOUTH TRUST FUND for aggressive acquisitions of technology driven skills will keep hundreds of thousands of youths busy and away from being used in the 2023 general election as political thugs.
HURIWA blames political thuggery in the past for the expansions of the frontiers of terrorism, banditry and sophisticated youths-led crimes and criminality which the group says will abate if the fund is passed into law and signed as soon as possible.

In a media release at the close of the brainstorming session in Owerri, Imo State, attended by leaders of credible civil rights organization drawn from the six geopolitical zones, the convener and head of the HURIWA has tasked both the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari to expedite action on the passage and signing into law of the bill to enable the NYSC’S management to set the ball rolling and to take young graduates in their hundreds of thousands out of the unemployment market.
“We reached a consensus that the idea of a TRUST FUND to be managed for the development and capacity building of young graduates and the expansion of infrastructures  by the NYSC all across Nigeria will inevitably become one of the biggest economic legacies to be bequeathed by any national leader of Nigeria alive and dead and therefore we resolve to send a letter to president Muhammadu Buhari and Senate president and his counterpart in the Federal House of Representatives to encourage them to quicken the process of actualizing the setting up of the NYSC’S Youth Trust Fund.

“We think that it is imperative to have a vibrant Trust Fund for young graduates to harness and develop their skills, innate talents and creative gifts for national growth because it will tremendously serve the greatest national security interest of Nigeria.
The NYSC’S YOUTH TRUST FUND fund create constructive impacts in the youth’s sector similar to what the evolution of Nollywood industry did in Africa as a pacesetter and creator of wealth for talented youths”.
HURIWA further recalled that Principally, the Bill seeks to establish the National Youth Service Corps Trust Fund Bill; control of Special Intervention Fund established under section 3; provide sustainable sources of funds for National Youth Service Corps; train and retraining of Corps Members under the National Youth Service Scheme; development National Youth Service Corps camps and Skills/Entrepreneurial training centres across the country; improve the general welfare of corps and corporate with all relevant ministries and agencies of Government to in improving corps members human capital development.
