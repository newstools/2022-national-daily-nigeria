The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has said Nigeria must return to the 1963 constitution and regional governments to avoid breaking up.
This was as he backed the statement that the crude oil in the Niger Delta belongs to the region and not Nigeria.
The statement was earlier made by the National Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress, Ebipamowei Wodu, who at a forum said the Ijaw were being treated like second-class citizens in Nigeria despite producing the oil and gas resources that are sustaining the country.
