With about a year to the next general elections in Nigeria, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, says God has not told him who will become Nigeria’s President in 2023.
The respected cleric said this on Saturday during the 2022 Crossover Service of the church held at the RCCG International Headquarters along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.
Adeboye, while announcing his prophecies for the Year 2022, said many people had been asking him who would succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in May 2023.
He, however, said God had not revealed Nigeria’s next President to him, adding that prophecy is no guesswork.
Speaking on Saturday, Adeboye said, “I just want to give you a hint of what Daddy (God) says is in store for the New Year. There are all manners of prophets out there. So, you will be hearing all manner of prophecies in the coming days. I am talking to you, my children, not criticizing anybody. I have my duty to make sure I teach my own children.

“When God speaks, He speaks specifically. There is no may be or perhaps; He speaks. So, if you hear somebody prophecy, ‘It is likely one of the following people will succeed’, that’s not a prophecy; that’s personal opinion. When God speaks, He will say, ‘This fellow will succeed, that fellow is not going to make it’. That is the way God speaks; He doesn’t say, ‘It is likely’.”
The 79-year-old cleric took a trip down memory lane and narrated how he was asked who would become Nigeria’s President in 1993. Adeboye said as the then President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, he was approached by his fellow pastors to know who would become Nigeria’s President between MKO Abiola of the Social Democratic Party and Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention during the planned transition to civilian rule by the military.
