Okorocha and Nwosu, his son-in-law and former guber candidate, are sponsors of banditry in the state, according to a statement on Tuesday by Oguwike Nwachuku, Governor Hope Uzodinma’s Chief Press Secretary.
He said suspects confirmed to security agencies that the former governor and his son-law fuel “kidnapping, banditry, arson and cannibalism” in the state.
Nwachuku said as Uzodinma prepared to expose the two, a media frenzy they sponsored has been trying to divert attention from them
“The current media frenzy by both Rochas Okorocha and Uche Nwosu appears to be strengthening the notion of their culpability.
“The duo have resorted to publishing falsehood yet again about security officers in the State Government House.
“Their claim of the arrest and detention of a certain Shaba, whom they falsely allege to be the CSO to the Imo State Governor is strange as the Governor’s CSO is not known by the name of Shaba,” he said.
According to him, no security officer in the governor’s security team was either arrested or is currently unaccounted for.
“Okorocha and Nwosu have been specifically mentioned by suspects who are in the custody of security agents, as being sponsors of kidnapping and banditry in Imo State, using their relationship with former ex-militants to perpetrate the crimes,” he alleged.
He said instead of clearing their names, they appear bent on using both overt and covert means to blackmail the Police High Command, “which legitimately arrested Uche Nwosu.”
