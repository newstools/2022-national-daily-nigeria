At a meeting in Mapo Hall, Ibadan, where the council whom the late Olubadan banned from his palace (because they are crowned chiefs), former Oyo Governor Rasidi Adewolu Ladoja was not present.
He is the only uncrowned member of the council and Osi Olubadan.
Many have seen Ladoja contending the throne with Lekan Balogun, the Otun Olubadan, on whose side other chiefs are.
While Ladoja was the only one present at the funeral of the late Oba, the other 11 chiefs were at Balogun’s working on his succession.
His lawyer and ex-AG Michael Lana wrote a letter earlier, warning Oyo Gov. Seyi Makinde to consider the legal and historical implication of crowning a chief–Balogun— twice.
Those who attended the Wednesday  meeting include the High Chief Lekan Balogun (Otun Olubadan), High Chief Owolabi Olakulehin (Balogun of Ibadan land) and High Chief Tajudeen Ajibola.
Others were High Chief Abiodun Kola-Daisi, High Chief Eddy Oyewole Foko and High Chief Amidu Ajibade.
