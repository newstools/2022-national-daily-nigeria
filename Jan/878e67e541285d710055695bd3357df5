Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari for complaining about working for six hours.
Omokri said Buhari is the reason why Nigeria is falling apart under his administration.
In a tweet, the former Presidential aide urged the president to go home and rest.
Omokri wondered why the president would work for only six hours when heads of organizations work for 12 hours.
According to Omokri: “Buhari complained of working for six hours daily, saying it’s too much for him. Can you imagine? No wonder Nigeria is falling apart under him.
“How can a President work for only six hours? When even CEOs of corporations work for 10-12 hours. Buhari, go home and rest!”
Buhari had said he is looking forward to his exit from office because age was telling on him.
Appearing on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) on Thursday night, the president said he is no longer comfortable working long hours every day.
