Afro-beats queen Tiwa Savage has come out to lament about the difficulties of not having a father like Dangote.
Remember Aliko Dangote is the richest man in Nigeria and in Africa and is the richest black man in the world. Now Tiwa Savage has taken to social media to reveal that she has been working super hard to make money since the year began. The singer stated that she has been in several meetings for days now and it is actually not easy.
Just recently the mother of one was seen chilling and hanging out with fellow singer Davido alongside their kids in Ghana and they definitely had a blast.
Now she wrote, I have one more meeting. It’s not easy looking for money o. God help me but why my papa no be Dangote or something like that (may his soul rest in peace though)
