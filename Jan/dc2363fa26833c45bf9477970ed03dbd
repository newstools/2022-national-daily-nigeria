In a statement released by Air Commodore Wap Maigida, acting Director Defence Information, the Defence Headquarters says it has noticed that the campaign posters of some Governors, dressed in military camouflage uniforms, displayed in noticeable areas in their respective states. Maigida said this is illegal and an abuse of privilege.
”This is manifestly illegal and an abuse of the privilege of allowing civilians wear military uniforms during military training exercises.
It is necessary to restate that the Armed Forces of Nigeria, as a professional institution, remains apolitical and, as such, would not want to be dragged into any form of political bias.
Accordingly, it is important to advise politicians and others to desist from the use of military uniforms and accoutrements for political events and other engagements henceforth.” the statement reads in part.
Maigida stressed that anyone found culpable in this regard would be liable to prosecution.
