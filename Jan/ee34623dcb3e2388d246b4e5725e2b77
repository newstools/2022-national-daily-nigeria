Fashola had said that during an interaction with the APC youth in Kano Thursday
Making a clarification while inspecting the ongoing Abuja-Kaduna-Kano road project on Friday January 28, Fashola said he didn’t say that Nigeria’s infrastructure is better than America’s infrastructure.
“Certainly anybody who knows what he is doing will know that America is a much richer nation, their infrastructure is well ahead of Nigeria.
“What I was talking about at the presentation with the APC youth was about the challenges of infrastructure, and that it is universal, every country commits to infrastructure as a legitimate way to create work, grow the economy and distribute wealth as we have seen here. That’s the first point I am making.
“And that in a democracy, you always need parliament to authorise what you spent in infrastructure. So, I was making the comparison that Buhari has been able to get his parliament to authorise his spending, and that is why we are able to gather here.
“But that the American government is struggling to get authorisation from their own parliament to start what we are already doing. I didn’t say that our infrastructure is better than theirs.”
