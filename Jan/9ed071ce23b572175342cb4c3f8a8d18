Many people are sure that only a few people make money on Forex, and the rest of the traders are only wasting their time and money sitting in front of the screen for days. There are those who believe that only professional financial analysts can get income here. In fact, this is not true. There are many ways to generate income in Forex.

How to Start Making Money on Forex
If you have read about Forex before, you probably understand that you can actually start making money here from scratch. To do this, it is not even necessary to independently engage in trade. If you have a certain amount of funds that you are ready to invest in Forex, you can give them under the personal management of professional traders. They will trade in the market, and you will make a profit in accordance with the trader’s income. Of course, in this case, you will have to pay a commission to the manager. However, for a person who does not want to understand all the intricacies of trading, this option would be ideal.
How much can one make in Forex?
This question is asked by many beginners, but it is not possible to give an unambiguous answer to it. In theory, everyone can receive income from trading in the currency market in the amount of both 100% and even 1,000%. However, in reality, everything is much more complicated.
If you look at the facts, you can understand that even experienced Forex traders that are serious world-renowned companies earn about 20% of profits per year. For the most successful traders, income varies between 30-40% of net profit. Some part of this money is “returned” back to trade, some money is used to pay taxes. But with enough investment, you can still make good money – this is an indisputable fact.
How to Make a Profit on Forex: Tips for a Beginner
One of the incredibly popular ways for beginners to generate income in Forex is the standard copying of trades that professional traders make. This is convenient since it is quite difficult for a new person in the market without trading experience to quickly navigate Forex, independently analyze the market, and understand what candlestick patterns are. For copying transactions, special services have been created that allow traders to perform all actions automatically. The main task for a beginner is to correctly choose a trader whose deals to copy. By following the recommendations of a broker like Forextime, you will surely select the right trader to copy.
And it is essential to keep in mind that even experienced traders might make mistakes, and in the case of loss, there is no one to blame.

Trading on your own
You can make stable money on the foreign exchange market in Nigeria, China, India, or any other country, by traditional trading. First, you need to choose a broker. Make sure that a chosen intermediary is trusted, reliable, and officially registered. Do not underestimate this step since choosing a trustworthy broker is one of the keys to success.
Then you will have to learn and constantly trace the exchange rate, try to buy it as cheaply as possible, and sell your assets at higher rates. It is clear that this requires some experience, but with due diligence, you can master the market and decide on your own trading strategy.
Final Words
Forex trading is still popular among regular people without financial experience. So, if you have been looking for a way to make a profit, 2022 is a good year to get started. But be prepared that trading requires persistence in learning, following the schedule of trading, and developing analytical skills.
