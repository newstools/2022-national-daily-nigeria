There is a major change to the legal tram of the embattled leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, on the resumption of trial on Tuesday. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, now leads the legal team defending Nnamdi Kanu in his trial for Terrorism, Treason and Other offences by the Federal Government at the Federal High Court, Abuja. Before now, Ifeanyi Ejiofor was the lead counsel to Nnamdi Kanu.
However, Ejiofor was present in court at the resumption of the trial on Tuesday even as Chief Mike Ozkhome leads the defence team.
At the resumed trial on Tuesday, the Department of State Service (DSS) barricaded major roads to the headquarters of the Federal High Court, Abuja. to tighten security in the vicinity.
The Federal Government amended the charges on Monday, filing 15 fresh charges against Nnamdi Kanu. This was challenged at the resumed trial on Tuesday by the lead counsel.
