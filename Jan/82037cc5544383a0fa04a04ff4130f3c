Otu Inyang was coming back from a Qua Ibo Church at Ukot Udoma , Eket,  after the crossover  service January 1 when his attackers ambushed him some meters away to his house.
Church members who spoke said they thought the gunshots were sounds from fireworks.
Confirming the incident, the President of Ekid Peoples Union and former governorship candidate Samuel Udonsek, said he got the news with great discomfort and sadness.
“I must say that this model of conflict resolution is uncommon in Ekid land. I knew Elder Otuinyang very well, back in our days in ANPP 2000 – 2003 when he helped us build a formidable opposition party. Late Prof Etuk Nssien Etuk, of blessed memory, regarded him rightly then as a formidable pillar of his strong and resilient political empire and structure,” he stated.
“For me, and indeed the generality of the remnants of our old ANPP structure; a great friend and loyalist has departed, may God in his infinite mercies forgive whatever his human frailties were and accept his soul to eternal rest in paradise.
Th state police spokesman, Odiko Macdon said the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme has ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Police in the state to conduct a discreet investigation into the incident and ensure that the culprits are brought to book.
“We are on top of the situation and I want to assure you that the culprits will not escape.” he stated.
