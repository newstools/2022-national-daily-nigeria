A Nigerian woman, Lawiza Muazu, has dragged her husband, Alhaji Muazu, before the Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Unguwar Idi, Gombe State, over claims of domestic violence.
Lawiza in the court documents accused her husband of biting her while they were quarreling. She also alleged that her husband beats her regularly when they have misunderstandings.
“The latest quarrel we had was when I refused to cook food for the house. My action was a result of the non-provision of firewood or charcoal by him.
When he beat me for the first time, I went home, but my father asked me to go back. My husband later resorted to biting me after the beating. He would bite my fingers for refusing to cook food.”
She, therefore, asked the court to dissolve her marriage with Muazu saying she could no longer tolerate him.”
The husband denied biting and beating Lawiza.
“She refused to cook for one week which contravened the gentleman agreement that my two wives will serve food to the house on their cooking days.”he said.
Muazu explained that as a result of that the co-wife Jummai refused to give Lawiza the food she prepared.
“In protest of not being served by her co-wife, Lawiza got hold of me demanding for her right. She put her hands in my pocket trying to remove money by force. It was as a result of it that quarrel ensued between us but I never bit her,” Muazu added
