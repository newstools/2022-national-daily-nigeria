Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State is currently restoring streetlights across the state, replacing the old facilities of electricity lighted bulbs with solar power. The governor has extended his Light Up Lagos policy to the major roads and streets in the state, from the urban to the urban periphery and the remote new towns.
Street Light vehicles of the Light Up Lagos unit of the state government have in the past few weeks been dispatched to various parts of the state, with officials working beyond official office hours into Saturdays and Sundays replacing the old lighting system with solar power facilities. The officials were sighted in various areas from Surulere to Yaba, Ikeja and the suburbs, etc.
The upgrading or conversion of the streetlight in Lagos to solar energy will save the state government huge costs from the old system of powering the streetlight in various parts of the state with generators.
The replacement of the lighting facilities is still going on.
