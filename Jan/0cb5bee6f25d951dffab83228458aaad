The popular Yoruba adage which says everyday for the thief and one day for the owner seems to have played out when three armed robbers who snatched a motorcycle from their victim last year in Delta State have been arrested in Bayelsa State, the Delta State Police Command announced on Wednesday, January 26.
The three robbers, whose names were given as George Akporie, aged 25 years; Prosper Asaeta, aged 29 years and Eziekel Stephen, aged 23 years, were arrested around Sagbama in Bayelsa State by operatives from Oleh Division of the state command who went to Bayelsa State for a discreet investigation following a tip-off received from the victim by the policemen.
It was gathered that the three young men in March, 2021 shot a motorcycle rider and snatched a motorcycle from him at a point between Olomoro and Ehwne in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State and went away with the motorcycle to Bayelsa State.
According to a statement by the Delta State police command through its Public Relations Officer, Bright Edafe, posted on the Facebook wall of the command on Wednesday, the victim was taken to a hospital following the injuries he sustained and was later discharged after treatment.
It was also gathered that the victim, on January 23, went to Sagbama and saw one of the robbers in the area. He was said to have quickly alerted policemen, causing operatives from Oleh Division to proceed to Bayelsa State for a discreet investigation with a view to arresting the robbers.
However, after some days, the three robbers were eventually arrested at Sagbama and were brought down to the Oleh Division of the Delta State police command for more investigation.
The statement added that at the point of their arrest, one locally-made pistol was recovered from them just as they were said to be giving useful information to the policemen over the incident.
According to the police statement, the three robbers are expected to be charged to court upon completion of investigation.
