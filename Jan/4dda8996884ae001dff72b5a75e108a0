Sensing that they are failing and citizens’ resistance is building, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has backtracked, and asked countries to end or ease COVID restrictions, saying they have not helped.
For long, since, 2020, President, LoveWorld Incorporated Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, has championed a global sensitization to enlighten governments of nations to jettison the idea of lockdowns and restrictions that were purportedly based on measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19.
According to the Cleric, these lockdowns are actually lockups and they are unscientific.
On Wednesday, WHO recommended nations lift or ease their existing COVID-19-related travel restrictions, saying they could exacerbate economic and social stress related to the pandemic.

According to WHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on COVID-19 report following its most recent meeting, WHO advised countries to lift the bans and restrictions because the committee found “they do not provide added value and continue to contribute to the economic and social stress experienced” by citizens.
The report said such travel restrictions failed to limit the international spread of the omicron variant of the virus that causes COVID-19, which, the committee said, demonstrates the ineffectiveness of such measures over time.
The report went on to say other travel safety measures such as masking, testing, isolation/quarantine, and vaccination should be based on risk assessments to avoid placing an excess financial burden on international travelers.
