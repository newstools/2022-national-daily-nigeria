The Police in Delta State is currently on a manhunt of a 24-year-old boy, Nana Oyibo, for allegedly stabbing to death his neighbour, one Onos Obadeke during a heated argument.
National Daily gathered that the incident occurred on Tuesday evening at Old Eku road in Sapele, Sapele Local Government Area of the state, thereby throwing the neighbourhood into mourning.
It was gathered that the suspect fled after he learnt that Onos had died on his way to the hospital after he (Nana) stabbed him with using a broken bottle over an unresolved dispute.
Our security source said the victim, Onos died after losing so much blood in the process because the suspect stabbed the deceased in the chest.
He also said the suspect fled the scene after stabbing the deceased on the chest losing so much blood in the process.
However, a source close to both families added that the two young men were living with their parents in the same compound “though they were neighbours their families were not in talking terms.
Their younger siblings were the ones who began fighting each other until the late Onos and Nana now started fighting, Nana then picked up a bottle, broke it and proceeded to stab Onos” the source who craved anonymity said.
Sympathizers were said to have made efforts to save Onos life by rushing him to hospital, but he died before he could be treated.
The security forces who begged not to be mentioned said efforts were on to arrest the fleeing suspect.
“I am sure that the suspect would not escape because our men are out there to arrest him,” the source added.
