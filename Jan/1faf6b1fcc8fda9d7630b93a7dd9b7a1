Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has revealed that the Lagos State rail system will become operational in the fourth quarter of 2022. The governor expressed that the two new sets of 10 cars Talgo 330kmph trains for the state’s red line rail project will begin movement of passengers towards the end of 2022.
The governor, however, explained that while the terminal stations will be ready this year, transporting passengers may start in 2023. He explained further that delay is to allow time for proper testing of the trains and training of workers to develop operational competence for the safety of passengers.
