Edo Deputy Governor Philip Shuaibu has pledged support for the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for the presidency in 2023.
The PDP politician said Osinbajo, a likely presidential aspirant from the ruling APC, is the best candidate for the position.
“The era of godfathers are over in this country, it is now the era of good leadership and progressive leadership. Men that have intellect, men that will turn our state into an industrial state so that those who are unemployed will be gainfully employed,” he said while speaking the installation ceremony of Clem Agba, minister f state for planning, in Auchi on Saturday.
Osinbajo was special guest of honor.
“Your Excellency, just know that you have all of us in Edo, you have us, anything that you want to do, you have us and you have God. And by the Grace of God, we will have our own as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023,” he said.
“By the special grace of God, we will mobilise ourselves so that we can take our destiny in our hands. The EndSARS was a clarion call to all of us not just in Edo but the entire nation.
Shuaibu and his boss Godwin Obaseki defected from the APC to the PDP in 2020.
Going by this open campaign for the APC and a candidate that has yet to declare his intention, their position and future in the new party is not clear.
