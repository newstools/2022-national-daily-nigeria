The Senator representing Kano Central and leader of G7, Ibrahim Shekarau, has opened up on the rift between him and the incumbent governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Ganduje.

It would be recalled that the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Committee Chairman, and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, and Jigawa State Governor, Mohammad Abubakar, met in Abuja, on Tuesday, with the warring factions of the party in Kano, so as to reconcile the groups.


In an audio tape, Shekarau expressed his readiness to reconcile with the Ganduje-led faction on strict conditions of equity and fairness to all members of All Progressive Congress in Kano.

Reacting to the reconciliatory move, Shekarau said he was not against any peace initiatives by the party.

He said, “The reconciliatory committee was inundated with our successes at the court and the current situation of the party.

‘’We told the committee that we are ready for peace discussion but with conditions. The conditions are respect for party members, equity and fairness among all, so that everybody’s rights are protected.

‘’The struggle we are embarking on is not to create chaos or disrespect anybody, but to ensure that the efforts create a level playing field for everybody.

“The Almighty God emphasised that reconciliation is very good but we should be sensible, honest and ensure fairness in carrying out the action.’’
