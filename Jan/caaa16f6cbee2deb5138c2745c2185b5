A former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani, on Tuesday decried the menace of bandits and Boko Haram insurgents in the country, accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of lying to Nigeria that his administration has defeated insurgency in the country.
Sani, a staunch critic of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, said in a post on his Facebook page the bandits had established a governance structure, imposed taxes and levies on the people, kidnapped for ransom and installed traditional rulers and Imams, while the government continued to deceive Nigerians with claims of success in the fight against the criminals.

He wrote: “Virtually now, bandits in the North-West have become a state within a state.
“Bandits have been able to establish governance structure in the sense that they don’t just kidnap and extort money, it has reached a point where they even install.
“They even install traditional rulers and Imams in these communities. And all of these are happening under the watch of President Buhari.
“And they will continue to lie to Nigerians that they have defeated the bandits and terrorists.”
