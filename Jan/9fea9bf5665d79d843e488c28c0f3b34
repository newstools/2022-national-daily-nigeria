Stop celebrating “untraceable wealth”- Nobel Igwe
Blogger and Businessman Noble Igwe has spoken out following the rise of criminal acts of young boys trying to do diabolical rituals to get wealth. He said that society should be blamed for the craze for ill-gotten wealth and he mentioned ways that society encourages such heinous behavior.


He pointed out that people are celebrated when they show off “overnight untraceable success”.


He said that such people are quickly given titles, preferential treatment, and respect. As a result, more “people will kill or commit a crime to get such a treatment”.


He added that some Churches receive donations from anyone with money, not minding the source and families do not question their children’s wealth.


He called on Nigerians to stop celebrating “untraceable wealth”.
