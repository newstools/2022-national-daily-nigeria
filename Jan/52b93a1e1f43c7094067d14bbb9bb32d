Two suspected armed robbers have been set ablaze by an angry mob beside the Conoil Filling Station, Onitsha, Anambra State.
The incident happened in the early hours of Thursday on the Awka-Enugu Road.
An eyewitness, who asked not to be identified, said the suspects, who came on a motorcycle, robbed some Awada residents of their money and phones, among other items, and shot several times in the air to scare people before trying to escape.
