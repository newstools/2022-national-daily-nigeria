The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been facing uncertainty over the zoning of reh presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections. This has led to deepened consultations and negotiations by the party’s stakeholders after the PDP national chairman had been zoned to the north, and Dr. Iyorcha Ayu emerged the PDP leader.
The zoning of the PDP national chairman to the north presupposed that the presidential ticket has been zoned to the south, according to the leading parties practice over the years.
Meanwhile, former Governor Babangida Aliyu of Niger State, at the weekend revealed that the PDP has reached an agreement to zone its presidential ticket to the north, notwithstanding earlier decision that any party member can contest the presidential ticket.
Former Governor Aliyu, hosting the Atiku Support Organisation in Minna, Niger State, coordinated by Dr. Victor Moses, promised his support for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, expressing his confidence that the group will succeed.
Aliyu stated: “In our zoning agreement, we have agreed to re-zone the presidency to the North as requested by others but we have agreed written openly as a result of what has happened that any candidate from any part of the country can now contest this election.”
The National Coordinator of the Atiku Support Organisation, Dr Victor Moses, acknowledged the continuous support of Aliyu for Atiku for the 2023 presidential election.
