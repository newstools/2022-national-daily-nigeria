An APC group in the north central is taking up its party national leader Bola Tinubu on a statement he made in 1997, two years before he became Lagos governor.
The Sen. Tinubu had said in an interview with ThisDay that he didn’t believe in one Nigeria.
The group which claims it’s working  for emergence of a president from the region said Tinubu owes Nigerian an apology now the he wants to rule one Nigeria.
“In ThisDay publication of April 13th, 1997, Tinubu granted an interview in which he was quoted as saying, ‘I don’t believe in One Nigeria’. And since that interview has resurfaced as a result of his presidential ambition declaration, people have began to raise eyebrow and asking damaging questions,” said Saleh Mandung Zazzaga in Jos, Plateau, on Monday.
“So many people have been calling and mocking us (the party), saying that if Tinubu does not believe in One Nigeria, how come he has now believed in one Nigeria to the extent that he wants to contest for the Presidency of a Nation he did not believe in?”
The group’s spokesman said the statement, unaddressed, is not good for the well-being of the party as the nation counts down to the 2023 general election.
“The most honourable thing for Tinubu to do is come out and appologise to Nigerians on that remarks which he made before this democratic dispensation which began in 1999.
“And he should as well explain the rationale of the interview to Nigerians and point out if he was misquoted or not. Whatever his explanation would be, at least it will calm down people’s nerves and save the party from being projected in a bad light.
“Such apology will not only project him as a true leader of the party or as presidential aspirant but it will prove that he is a man of honour and dignity and someone who will take responsibility for his words, deeds and actions,” he said.
