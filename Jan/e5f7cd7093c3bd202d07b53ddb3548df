Engineer Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the governor of Lagos State on drainage and water resources was on his Facebook account to react after Atiku Abubakar said he will also contest for the position of the president in 2023.
Joe Igbokwe started by quoting Atiku Abubakar saying “I will contest in 2023”, after that, Joe Igbokwe then reacted to the statement by saying “customer daa daa”, which means a very good customer.
Atiku Abubakar is a former vice president of Nigeria, and ever since he vacated office as the vice president he has been trying hard to become the president of the country via different political parties. According to Wikipedia, Atiku Abubakar has contested for the position of the president five times since he joined politics in 1993. He contested in 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019.
President Buhari also contested three times before he finally became the president of Nigeria in 2015. So I believe Atiku Abubakar stands a chance to become the president also but he just has to be consistent and keep pushing, one day his dream will come through and people will celebrate with him, it’s just a matter of time.
