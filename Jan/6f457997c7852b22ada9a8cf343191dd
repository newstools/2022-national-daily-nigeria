The Civil Society Network for Urban Regeneration (CISNUR) has reiterated call on concerned authorities, to expedite actions on the plan to resettle displaced traders and automobile technicians in the provided 6th Avenue Market area and mechanic village of Festac Town.

CISNUR harps on the importance of speedy intervention on the matter in a separate letters to President Mohammadu Buhari, Honourable Minister for Works and Housing Mr. Babatunde Fashola, Managing Director/CEO Federal Housing Authority (FHA) Senator Olugbenga Ashafa and the Executive Governor Lagos State Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu.


The group which is a consortium for Center for Leadership and Creative Entrepreneurs in Africa (CELCE-Africa) added that the lingering legal feud between the FHA and the royal family in Amuwo-Odofin had been the bane of development in the area.

The Convener of CISNUR and Founder/President of CELCE-Africa Amb. Kingsley Nwanze stated in the  separate letters to concerned authorities, the good intentions of the FHA boss in restoring the lost glory of Festac Town.

He opined that the legal dispute on the said portion should be speedily wrested to make the resettlement of the affected individuals seamless.

“This is very necessary because the displaced traders and automobile technicians are yet to be resettled in the new place provided.

“The FHA in an attempt to restore the lost urban glory of Festac Town, had proposed the 6th Avenue Market and Mechanic village.” Said Nwanze.
