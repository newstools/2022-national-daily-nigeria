The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, had ordered a thorough investigation into the killing of a driver by a military officer in Yobe State, northeast Nigeria. Several youths in Gashua had embarked on a mass protest of the killing of a driver, Mohammed Musa, by a military officer. The driver was said to be killed by military operatives on patrol at a petrol station in Garin Alkali, near Gashua, Bade Local Government Area, Yobe State on Saturday.
It was narrated that the military operatives stormed the petrol station for enforcement of the ban by the state government on sales of petrol in jerrycans. The military officers who were said to have arrived at the petrol station in motorcycles and vehicles did not harass or intimidate any citizen but urged the people not to be afraid of their presence. However, a driver was said to have attempted to flee from the petrol station out of fear and was shot by the military.
The youths went on rampage after the killing of the driver, expressing their griefs in solidarity songs, and demanding justice for the deceased.
Senate President Lawan added his voice calling on the military authorities to conduct thorough investigation into the shooting and killing of the driver in Yobe and ensure that the culprit is brought to book.
