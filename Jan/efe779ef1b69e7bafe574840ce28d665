No fewer than two bandit leaders on the wanted list of the Nigerian military have been bombed out in their dens inside Zamfara forest.
Alhaji Auta, Kachalla Ruga among others were killed early hours of Saturday.
According to PRNigeria, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft, under Operation Hadarin Daji, acted on credible intelligence, and bombarded the bandits’ enclaves, at Gusami Forest and Tsamre Village in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of the State.
Many of their cohorts were also neutralized in the air raid.
Sources confirmed that dozens of bandits who had converged at late Auta’s residence, for his burial were also struck by missiles of the military jet, with an unconfirmed number killed in the process.
A military intelligence officer told PRNigeria that follow-up airstrikes conducted by the NAF fighter aircraft on fleeing bandits and those who took cover under trees within the area, resulted in heavy casualties on the side of the criminals.
“For now, the whereabouts of other notorious bandits like Alhaji Nashama, Shingi and Halilu who may either be incapacitated or on the run remain unknown,” a source told the agency.
“These operations have reassured citizens of the commitment and dedication of the military and other security agencies, towards bringing the threats posed by banditry under check, in no distant time.
“The citizens, especially around the affected communities, are enjoined to continually provide security agencies with credible information that will go a long way towards tackling the threats to their lives and livelihood,” he said.
