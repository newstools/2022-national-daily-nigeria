He shared a picture where he is on sick bed in a hospital.
“In the last one year, I have had many surgeries and procedures and I’m believing God this will be my last,” he wrote on Facebook.
“No matter how angry you have been about my outspokenness or outright naked challenge to power back then, please pray for me.
“The cankerworm had eaten deeply into my health, it has not been easy with me and I’ve only remained whole through the mercies of God.”
The PDP chieftain said he received scary news from his surgeons but hopes that God would heal him.
“I got some scary news from the surgeons today, but my faith remains in God Almighty and with your prayers and by His stripes I am healed and would remain whole in Jesus name,” Metuh said.
The EFCC arraigned Metuh in 2016 on seven counts of money laundering for allegedly receiving N400million from the national security adviser’s office.
Justice Okon Abang declared Metuh guilty on all counts of money laundering and sentenced him to seven years in prison.
Abang later granted him N250 million in bail.
While his trial lasted the, Metuh collapsed twice in court as the justice refused to grant his incessant prayers on health problems.
