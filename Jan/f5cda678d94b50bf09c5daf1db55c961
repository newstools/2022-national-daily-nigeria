Salihu Lukman accused the Yobe governor and others of lying to Nigerians, since consultations on the convention ended with the final meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari last November.
Lukman in a statement issued Thursday said it appeared that the caretaker committee has some hidden agenda
“Somehow, it is difficult not to conclude that the CECPC is intentionally promoting speculation around the APC National Convention by claiming to embark on consultations with party stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free National Convention.”
“Unless the CECPC has given itself the new responsibility of being the political and electoral undertaker of the APC, it must stop promoting some subversive campaigns suggesting that it is undertaking ‘the immediate task of addressing contestations within the party, litigations, fallouts of recently conducted Congresses and generally reposition the Party ahead of the National Convention.
” Once this is the case, it simply means the CECPC’s new objective is probably to take APC to its political grave. This should not be acceptable!”
The director-general wondered why the sub-committees for budget which is to mobilise funds for the convention had not been set up with just about two weeks to the end of January.
“There is need to ensure that the CECPC has no option but to organise the APC National Convention in February 2022 as decided based on all the consultations that have taken place,” Lukman said.
