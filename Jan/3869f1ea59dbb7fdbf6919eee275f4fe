Capital Market Operators (CMOs) in Nigeria have been directed not to conduct any form of business with individuals or group linked to terrorist groups.
The CMOs were warned by Nigeria’s Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the Federal Government made available a gazette last week, which declared that bandits had been designated as terrorists.
Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had signed a document proscribing activities of Yan Bindiga Group, Yan Ta’Adda Group and other similar groups as terrorists.
Capital market operators were told that any suspicious transactions recorded must be reported to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) for investigation.
