The United States of America and the United Kingdom have declined Nnamdi’s Kanu’s request to send representatives to observe his trial.
The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra sent letters of requests to the United States Ambassador in Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, urging her to send representatives to observe proceedings in his ongoing trial at the Federal High Court in Abuja to ensure a fair hearing.
Kanu, who is standing trial in a seven-count amended charge before Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja, also wrote the United Kingdom (UK) High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, requesting the presence of British envoys to observe the his trial holding at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division on January 18, 19, and 20.
However, two countries turned down his request.
While the US said it was limiting its employees from attending public gatherings, the UK explained that it does not normally attend a court case involving a British national.
The US Embassy and the British High Commission said these in separate responses to inquiries from Punch.
