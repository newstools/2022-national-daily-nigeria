Notorious bandits were on rampage in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of Zamfara State, killing 58 persons and burning several houses. Locals disclosed that the figure of casualties was higher than the 58 persons the government mentioned in the provocative onslaught, which was said to have commenced on Wednesday, extending into Thursday in the 48 hours operation. Higher casualties were said to have fallen on members of the communities’ vigilantes who were killed as they intervened to scuttle the operations of the bandits.
It was disclosed that 36 people died in Bukkuyum Local Government Area, and 22 persons were killed in Anka.
Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State, while visiting the injured victims in the hospital, re-assured that military are committed to eradicate the bandits in the state.
President Muhammadu Buhari had on Saturday condemned the mass killing in Zanfara by bandits, saying they were acting out of desperation.
According to Governor Matawalle: “Yesterday, we had a meeting up to 12.00am, Commissioner for Security, Army Commandant, the Director of DSS and others, we have already strategised and you are going to hear the results very soon maybe by Monday you will hear what we have done.”
Commending declaration of bandits as terrorists by the Federal Government, the Zamfara governor said: “We have all been waiting for this declaration, and I am personally happy with this declaration because before our military was not able to use some equipment to fight these bandits but with this declaration, now, they can be able to use any possible weapons to sweep out these criminals.
“We have started discussing with the higher authority on the best way the Tucano will be deployed to Zamfara State so that all the grey areas are going to be cleared Insha Allah.”
