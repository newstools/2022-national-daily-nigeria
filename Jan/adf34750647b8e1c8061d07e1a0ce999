In a recent development, the President of the federation, Muhammadu Buhari, has been working tirelessly and behind closed doors to ensure the successful zoning of the presidency to the North in 2027. Recall that there have been several debates concerning the zone that should be allowed to rule the country come 2023. While some supports that power should remain in the North, others are of the view that the Presidential ticket should be zoned to the south. However, how is Buhari working towards a northern candidacy in 2027?
According to an exclusive report from Sahara Reporters, the President has shunned former Lagos State Governor and the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, to throw weight behind his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. The report claims that Buhari has bowed to pressure from some Northern Governors, including Mai Mala Buni, to support the presidential ambition of the former president, Goodluck Jonathan who willingly relinquished power in 2015 after conceding defeat.

Although it is unclear whether Jonathan would consider this move but the report revealed that he has met with some prominent South-south ministers with the help of his associate, Mr. Dikivie Ikiogha, to stretch out the issue. If the plan goes well, Goodluck Jonathan would join the APC and would be able to complete his one-term tenure and power would return to the north for another eight years.
