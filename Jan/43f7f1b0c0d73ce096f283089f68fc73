Operatives of Osun Security Network Agency codenamed Amotekun on Wednesday arrested a suspect with mut!lated human parts in Igege town, Ola-Oluwa Southeast Local Council Development Authority of the state.


The suspect was almost l!nch!ed by residents, who accosted and forced him to unpacked the content of his “Ghana must Go” bag, which was discovered to be part of human body before he was rescued by Amotekun operatives.
According to report, although the suspect in the recorded video was heard saying he was set up by someone, the residents around laid brain-resetting sl*ps on him intermittently until he was ferried away by Amotekun operatives to their office in Telemu. Chairman, Ola-Oluwa Southeast LCDA, Sunday Olaifa, who confirmed the incident demanded comprehensive investigation into how the suspect found the part caught in his possession.
“It is true the man was caught with body parts, but we demanded that the case be diligently investigated as the suspect claimed he was set up by his “supposed” son-in-law, hence, the matter should be properly investigated,” he said.
