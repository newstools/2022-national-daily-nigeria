Human Rights activist, Deji Adeyanju has taken to his official Twitter handle to speak about the 2023 general election. He believed that the most coveted political position in Nigeria isn’t taken seriously and that’s why someone would wake up from a bad dream and declare an interest to run for the presidency.
Deji Adeyanju made it clear that he wouldn’t stop speaking the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it is to the ears. He believes that the seat of the president isn’t a position for jamboree and it should only be to whom the cap fits. He revealed that he would have contested for a political position if he was interested in such.
He wrote;
“You just wake up from a bad dream and say you want to run for president. Do you know what president is? Even in America where the system works, you can’t be making such jokes. I will continue to speak the uncomfortable truth.”
