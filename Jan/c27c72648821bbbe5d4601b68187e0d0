Among the scores killed was senior commander Mallam Ari in charge of the area.
A senior intelligence official said that the airstrikes conducted by super Tucanos were authorized after intelligence revealed over 40 terrorists converging at the fringes of Northeast Kirta Wulgo, close to a point where a suspected ISWAP flag was hoisted.
“Some were also seen with weapons around a nearby make-shift structure, which was a likely indication that the structure might have had a high calibre terrorist target.
“After the airstrikes, some of the surviving terrorists were observed making frantic efforts to put out the fire that ensued while others took to their heels.
“Indeed, the make-shift structures were significantly burnt and destroyed at the fringes.”
“Several ISWAP fighters were neutralized in the air strikes including one Mallam Ari who was identified as the Fiya of Kirta Wulgo.”
Fiya is a title held by the second in the hierarchy of the terrorists’ military structure.
NAF spokesperson Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, confirmed that the NAF indeed carried out some strikes in areas around Kirta Wulgo.
He, however, gave no further details of casualties.
