Babafemi said a trail showed they ran into a house located at 2B Saula Akinlolu way, Orchid Estate, which is the residence of 22-year-old Sunday Joshua (aka De General).
He said: “The young men started to make noise to prevent a search. The operatives introduced themselves as officers of NDLEA and submitted themselves for search before entry. This was done and a search was conducted.
“The search led to the recovery of drug exhibits including cannabis sativa; Tramadol 225mg, and some paraphernalia for drug use.
“This was after the suspect had requested to record on video the search, which the officers out of a sense of civility allowed. The video trending on social media was the moment the suspect and his friends decided to disrupt the bid to conduct a search of the house.
“In his confessional statement in custody, the suspect admitted ownership of the drugs recovered from his house.”
