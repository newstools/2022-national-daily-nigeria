And his reason for the foreboding prediction is not difficult to see as he warned the party during an interview with the Nigerian Television Authority last night.
The APC house is not in order, and the February national convention may not hold.
“We have a timeframe and we have to work because the four years circle is constitutional and can’t be interfered with by anybody. If the party can’t agree on the convention, then the opposition can take over,” he said.
“What did the PDP do? They thought the opposition couldn’t come together, but ACN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together and before PDP realized, they were thrown off, so they (APC members) can see.”
The president said he wanted the selection of those to occupy elective positions to come from the grassroots rather than by political godfathers.
“I succeeded in trying to make my position understood in the sense that I said we should start from bottom, then upwards, starting from wards to polling units, local governments, states and then Abuja so that the party in all constituencies will know that they earn their positions coming up and therefore when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together,” he said.
