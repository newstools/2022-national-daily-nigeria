According to Dokubo, Kanu has been instigating violence and his influence is making his followers continue their atrocities.
“They will come and be begging (the FG) to bring out Nnamdi Kanu. For what? For the people that he’s killing?,” he said in a Facebook Post.
“You take Mkpuru Mmiri (Crystal Methamphetamine), then eat the flesh of our people. What these evil men are doing to our people, do they have hearts?
“You take traditional rulers, chain them, you put guns inside their mouths because they are the people who are not allowing Biafra to come.”
Some lawmakers and leaders of thought in the southeast have said POB is not responsible for the insecurity in the region. Some ‘unknown gunmen’ have always been blamed.
Dokubo and Kanu were comrades in the Biafra struggle until money created bad blood between them.
Last year, Dokubo threatened within weeks, Kanu would be exposed, and last June, the IPOB leader was bundlied in from Kenya to come and resume hiss trial.
