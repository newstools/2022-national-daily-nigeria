Nigeria’s First Lady, Dr. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari has identified the lack of awareness as a major factor for the high rate of mortality from cancer in Nigeria. She made the statement while receiving members of the Nigerian Cancer Society on Tuesday, 25 January 2022 at the State House.
Mrs. Buhari said this was why the Future Assured Programme has remained active in creating awareness, holding screening sessions, and making referrals where necessary.
She reminded the team that World Cancer Day, which will soon hold on the 4th February 2022, would provide a veritable platform to accelerate the fight against cancer. She called on stakeholders to collaborate and intensify efforts in ensuring the proper implementation of the National Cancer Control Plan to reduce the death rate in Nigeria.
