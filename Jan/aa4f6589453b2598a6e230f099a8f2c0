Founder of an online news agency, Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, has expressed his anger with his news agency for referring to late Chief Ernest Shonekan as a Nigerian leader, saying he was a traitor.
He said the deceased betrayed late Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, in Nigeria’s quest for genuine democracy before and during the June 12 1993 era.
“Chief Ernest Shonekan: The end of a democracy traitor.
“When I learned of the death of Chief Ernest Shonekan at the age of 85. I could not hold my anger at the reporting (including at Sahara Reporters) that claimed he was a “Nigerian leader.”
“Truth is that Chief Shonekan wasn’t a leader, he was a traitor who betrayed Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola and a betrayer of Nigeria’s quest for genuine democracy before and during the June 12, 1993, era.
“Also, Chief Shonekan wasn’t an “Interim Leader” as reported in many news outlets, the illegal contraption he headed known as the “Interim National Government” which was put together by an equally evil traitor, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida was appropriately nullified by a Lagos High Court also in 1993 after he occupied the office of “President” only for 84 days.
“Nigerians should courageously address the sins of these bunch of wicked people, when they are alive or when they die. The people of Chile recently treated the death of Lucía Hiriart, the widow of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet with scorn even though she died at  99.”
