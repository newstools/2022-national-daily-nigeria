Tinubu however told newsmen so be it if they went to town with the IBB visit only.
“If you restrict my visit to this house that is it,” he said during a brief interview.
“Generally, I came to Niger State to commiserate with the Governor and the people of Niger State. And so, I can’t stop by without paying a courtesy call to the enigma General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, retired.”
Whatever happened during the closed-door meeting he had with Babangida?
“He gave me his prayers,”Tinubu replied.
“You want to know the outcome of the consultation? We are running a democracy”.
As expected, he fielded questions too about his presidential run.
“I took my decision voluntarily and I am running for the Presidency of the country. We are running a democracy. Thank you very much and God bless you.”
IBB has dismissed aspirants older than 60 as incapable of running Nigeria, and has even spoken well of V.P. Yemi Osinbajo as a capable.
