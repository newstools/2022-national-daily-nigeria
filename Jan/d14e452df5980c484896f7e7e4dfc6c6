Captain of the Super Eagles of Nigeria, Ahmed Musa, on Saturday assured that the Nigerian team is set to battle Egypt in the opening game of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Group D on Tuesday. He added that members of the team know what is at stake representing Nigeria in the competition in Cameroon.
Musa, after a training session of the Super Eagles in Cameroon on Saturday, declared: “Today’s training session was good and our conditioning is getting better and we are ready to play the first game.
“Ebuehi is in camp and we are expecting Collins and hopefully he arrives before tomorrow.
“We know it is important to win. Winning the AFCON will make a big impact on our country and our families.”
Nigeria and Egypt met last at the AFCON in 2010 in Angola; and Egypt defeated Nigeria 3-1 in that game. The Super Eagles players are building confidence they will not lose to Egypt this time.
