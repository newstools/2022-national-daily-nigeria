A fake lawyer, Adekola Adekeye is currently cooling his heels in the Lagos command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, after he was arrested by operatives of the command.
Adekeye’s stock-in-trade is forging documents to perpetrate fraud, the EFCC said.
A statement issued on Thursday by its Spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said Adekeye’s travail began on Tuesday, January 11, 2022 when he came to the Lagos Command of EFCC posing as a lawyer to secure the bail of a suspected fraudster, popularly known as ‘Yahoo Boy’ who is in the commission’s custody.
The statement said nemesis, however, caught up with Adekeye, when investigators dug in further to verify the documents he tendered to secure the bail of the suspected fraudster.

“A search at his residence further unearthed several forged documents dating back to 2005, including forged Lagos State University and Kwara State College of Education documents,” the statement said briefly.
According to the statement, the suspect also claimed to be the owner of “A.A. Emmanuel & Co. Chambers”, which he had been using to perpetrate frauds until his arrest.
“He will soon be arraigned in court,” it also added.
In the meantime, the commission has vowed that it will continue to ensure that such impostors using fake personalities and documents to procure the bail of suspects are made to face the wrath of the law.
