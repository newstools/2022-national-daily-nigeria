The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, denied on Friday that the President’s present administration, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) infrastructure is better than that of the United State of America (USA),
He said the president has been able to convince his parliament to approve his spending, compared to the United State.
