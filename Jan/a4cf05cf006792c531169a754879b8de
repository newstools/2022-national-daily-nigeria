“I did not know I was a Yoruba man until today. What is there about Yoruba that I should not be proud. They produced the first Black African Nobel laureate for an academic category (Wole Soyinka), and the first Black African military ruler to hand over to a civilian President which was Olusegun Obasanjo, the first Nigerian to win a Grammy Award was Sade Adu as well as the first person born and bred in Africa to have won a Pulitzer Prize was Dele Olojede.
“There are an estimated 15 Black billionaires on Planet Earth. Three of them are Yoruba. More than any ethnic nationality in Africa. It used to be four, but one of them was Folorunsho Alakija who slipped down the rankings”
“US President, Joe Biden, named a Yoruba man, Adewale Adeyemo, as deputy Treasury Secretary. This is the highest position to which a Black African has been appointed in US history. Another Yoruba man, Dr. Oluyinka Olutoye, became the first person on Earth to successfully perform a surgery by taking out an unborn fetus from its mother’s womb and putting it back after the surgery. Thank you and may God bless you.” He ended
