The National Daily reported earlier that the schoolpupil was kidnapped early December by two suspects who later killed her because she recognized them.
It is now clear Abdulmalik Tanko, the proprietor of the school, headed the kidnap ring.
As Hanifa’s parents sighted Tanko, they charged at him, and slapped and tugged and cursed until the police had to separate them.
Fatima’s, Hanifa’s mothers, kept asking why the proprietor would kill her five-year-old pupil.
The suspects were arrested in the process of collecting part of the N5-million ransom they demanded even after poisoning and dismembering the girl.
Her remains were buried on the school premises.
