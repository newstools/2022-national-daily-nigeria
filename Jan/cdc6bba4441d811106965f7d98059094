The SWAT team occupying the former FSARS’s Adeniji base has been accused of harassing and extorting people in the same way as SARS officials did.
Segun Awosanya alias Segalink informed us about this.
He claimed that the SWAT team, which was formed to replace SARS following the End SARS protests, had begun harassing citizens as well.
Segalink said a citizen was apprehended at gunpoint Wednesday night, Jan. 25, at the Lekki Ikoyi Link Bridge by members of a SWAT team led by an officer named Lekan. They allegedly extorted N550K from him. Segalink stated that he interfered and the money was recovered, adding that the police involved are likely to report to the State Police Command’s CP’s office.




“I wonder why any SWAT team should be roaming peaceful streets when it was against their SOP which is specifically to respond to emergencies regarding armed robbery and kidnapping. Why have they suddenly become the kidnappers & armed robbers?! Who authorized their operation?!” Segalink wrote on Twitter.
