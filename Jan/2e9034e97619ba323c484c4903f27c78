Writer and Dareheights founder, Oyewole Michael went to Twitter to ask for information regarding the whereabouts of a boy who is believed to be the boyfriend of Jennifer Anthony. Jennifer was found dead with her eyes and other body parts removed, indicating that the murder might be for a ritual. He stated:
“Please if you know this guy or have any information about him reach out to me. The lady in the video was last seen with him. He was her boyfriend. The lady was found with her eyes and body parts removed.
Her name is Jennifer Anthony. Donuts Oasis guest house, opposite Parma motors, Zaria road, Jo’s, Plateu state. Anyone with information should kindly reach out to me. May she rest in peace. May her killers be found and brought to justice”.
Jennifer, a University student went missing on the 31st of December. She was later found with her eyes and other body parts missing in a hotel, indicating that she might have been killed for ritual purposes. They had been searching for her for days only to find her dead.




Many don’t believe that ritual murders exist but then why would a person have their eyes removed if it’s just a case of murder. It’s really scary what people will do to have wealth and fancy lifestyles. Snakes, zombies and body parts are all believed to be able to make people rich, at terrible cost. It’s also scary to think that someone you trust might be the one to sacrifice you. A sad story.
