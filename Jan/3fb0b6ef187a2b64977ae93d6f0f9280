The former presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has reacted to the decision of the federal government to lift the ban on Twitter’s operations in Nigeria.

Posting on his Facebook account following the reversal of the ban on Wednesday, January 12, Garba said Nigerians will gain a lot if they stay firm and do the right thing.


“Twitter ban is lifted. I can’t wait for my first tweet. We’ve won Jobs, Tax, and International office for Nigeria. This is what we gain when we stay firm and do the right thing.
Alhamdulillah.” he wrote.


The National Daily reports that Garba had earlier said that he was happy with the ban of Twitter in Nigeria and described the micro-blogging site as an “anti-Nigeria force” designed to destroy the country.
