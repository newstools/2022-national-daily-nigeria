It would be recalled that the president who was scheduled to visit Zamfara State on Thursday, but the visit was later canceled and rescheduled for next week.
According to Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, the flight was canceled due to bad weather conditions.
President Buhari was earlier expected to proceed to Zamfara from Sokoto State where he commissioned some projects provided by the state government.
Reacting, Reno, a former presidential aide, said Buhari canceled the trip because “bandits in Zamfara have Surface-to Air-Missiles”.
In a post on his Facebook page, Reno said, “the report that General Buhari canceled his trip to Zamfara because of bad weather is false.
“Buhari canceled the trip because bandits in Zamfara have Surface-to-Air-Missiles. Remember that on Sunday, July 18, 2021, they shot down an airforce jet in Zamfara!
“Compare the soft touch he gives them to the iron fist treatment he unleashed on IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho.
