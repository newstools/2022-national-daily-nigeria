“These bandits operate in the periphery because their hiding place is in the forest. It’s a major problem. The security agencies are doing their best but they are overstretched,” he said on Arise TV Tuesday.
“The reality is we don’t have enough boots on ground to address the myriad of security challenges that we face, and these security challenges are asymmetric, widespread, and there’s no part of Nigeria that doesn’t have one security problem or the other.
“Ramp up the number of boots and more technology and more investment in armament and wipe these guys once and for all.
“I’ve always believed that, you know, we should carpet-bomb the forests; we can replant the trees after. Let’s carpet-bomb the forests and bomb all of them.”
Carpet bombs go meters down to the ground, turning up the soil and the vegetation.
