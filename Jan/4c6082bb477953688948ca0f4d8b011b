Former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, says he has huge support base across the country that can deliver him the 2023 presidency should he decides to join the presidential race.
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) former governor in an interview with DW Hausa on Wednesday said he has, however, begun consultation on the presidential election and decision would be made public soon.
He said: “In this kind of situation we are not rushing to make decisions.
“So, we are critically watching and consulting the right people to advise us and whatever I decide will be communicated to our people.
“We have huge support that is enough to contest for anything.
“We have people everywhere not only in Nigeria. Some people think that we only have people in Kano or in the north, but the truth is we have people in Asia, America and Europe,” Kwankwaso said.
On the rumours circulating that he will dump his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Kwankwaso said there was nothing like that on the ground, and that he is not in negotiations with anybody about it.
“The issue of my decamping to APC has been raised severally at different times.
“This is not the first time. Many people are saying it and this is worth celebrating in politics that you become the talk of the news all the time.
“It is a symbol of integrity and that people are always with us.
“For now, I’m not aware of this and I’m not in any discussion with anybody about decamping to APC. So, that is it for now.”
He said politics is all about patience and hard work, and that it was normal with the system to experience good and bad situations.
