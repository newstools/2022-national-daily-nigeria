Former Gov. of Anambra, Peter Obi has urged all tiers of government to see investment in education as a veritable tool in the fight against poverty, insecurity and other societal ills.
This is contained in his message to mark the 2022 International Day of Education, which was issued on Wednesday in Enugu by his Media Officer, Mr Valentine Obienyem.
Obi noted that he had always advised governments at all levels to see their financial commitments in the education sector as investments and not expenses.
According to him, the more government invests in education, the better the economic growth and development the society will record.
“With investment in education, the issues of insecurity and poverty will be greatly reduced.
“Education is the most important tool for the socio-economic, political, scientific and technological advancement of any society, and it is a tool for poverty eradication and human development.”
The former governor said “education is the most important investment any nation can make”.
He observed that most of the ills being experienced in the country were as a result of past and present non-attention to education, adding that governments, at all levels should always prioritise investment in education.
Obi also advised Nigerian students to always take their education seriously as it remains the only capital they need and would lead them to greater heights in life.
The National Daily reports that the International Day of Education, held annually on Jan. 24, is a day dedicated by the United Nations to commemorate education and proffer solutions to its challenges.
