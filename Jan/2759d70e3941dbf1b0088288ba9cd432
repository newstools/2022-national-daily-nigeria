The lawmaker representing Osun Central district in the 9th Assembly, Sen. Ajibola Bashiru, has said no amount of gang-up would stop the re-election of the incumbent governor of Osun state, Adegboyega Oyetola.
The former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice for Osun stated this while admonishing politicians planning to contest the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress for Osun 2022 election against the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to be civil.
Speaking in Igbajo during the inauguration of Ada-Igbajo road, Bashiru said the government is not against anybody coveting the state’s number one political position, but that no amount of gang-up would stop Oyetola’s re-election.

The lawmaker volunteered to lend money to any of those planning to contest the APC governorship ticket against Oyetola but did not have enough money.
“We are not saying no one should contest against Governor Oyetola in the primary. What we are saying is that no one should take the advantage to hurl abuses on any member of the party or the personality of Mr. Governor,” Bashiru said.
The likes of ex-secretary to the state governor, Moshood Adeoti; ex-Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Yusuf Lasun; and ex-Speaker, Osun state House of Assembly, Najeem Salaam, had already signified intention to vie for APC governorship ticket.
