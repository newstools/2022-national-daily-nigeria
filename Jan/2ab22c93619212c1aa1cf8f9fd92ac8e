Alao-Akala died in the early hours of Wednesday in Ogbomoso at the age of 71 years. He was Governor of Oyo State 2007 to 2011, and Deputy Governor of the state under former Governor Rashidi Ladoja.
Governor Okowa in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, noted that the passing of Alao-Akala at this critical time of the country’s political history was painful and regrettable.
He said that the former governor contributed immensely to the development of his state as a former Deputy Governor to Alhaji Rashidi Ladoja, and later as Governor of the state.
“The late Alao-Akala was a patriot and a political icon whose life-long dedication and indefatigable commitment to serving the people will continue to be remembered.
“His contributions to the socio-political and economic development of Nigeria and indeed, humanity will remain indelible.
“On behalf of my family, the government and people of Delta, I commiserate with his family, Governor Seyi Makinde, the government and people of Oyo State, numerous friends, associates and admirers of the deceased politician.
“It is my prayer that God grant the immediate family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” Okowa stated.
