A person faints when blood does not get to the brain enough thus depriving it of necessary oxygen and nutrient.
It is common to see people attempt to revive someone who has fainted by different methods which unknown to them, are actually more potential health dangers to the victim. One of such is pouring water on them.
It should be known that to correct a medical condition is to control the underlying cause. If fainting is caused by deprived oxygen to the brain, there is no way pouring water on a victim will supply the needed oxygen and nutrient and thus is medically ineffective. Others go as far mixing water & glucose to force it down the unconscious victim’s throat.
While all of these are innocent attempts to revive the person, the potential harm should also not be overlooked. One of the main dangers is the risk of fluid aspiration, where water or any concocted mixture gets into the lungs.
According to one consultant surgeon, Prof. Andrew Ugburo, “fanning, foot slapping or pouring water to revive someone who has fainted could make them aspirate and infact dangerous. If it enters the lungs, you would have compounded the problem of that person. Anything outside the proper resuscitation of a patient is tantamount to a delay that can lead to death.”
Other things to also avoid include:
1. Leaving the person unattended to
2. Slapping the person on any part of the body in an attempt to revive them
3. Putting a pillow under their head to support them. This can disrupt their breathing pattern
4. Trying to get them to sit up
