But he was lying. He killed the victim.
The suspect Timothy Odeniyi, 35, was apprehended by men of Amotekun Corps, and paraded on Monday.
Odeniyi was to deliver the human parts in Lagos State.
According to him, he got the human hands and legs from a cemetery at Sabo axis of Ondo town, the headquarters of the Ondo West Local Government Area of the state.
His former boss in a brewery where he used to drive a truck sent him to get the human parts to be used for money ritual.
“I went to the cemetery to cut the legs and hands of one of the bodies buried there. I had planned to deliver the parts to the person who sent me in Lagos before I was apprehended. Once I deliver the items, he promised to give me N30 million,” he said.
“The burial ground I went is in Ondo town’s Sabo axis to chop the parts; I didn’t kill anyone, and it was my first time. I used to drive a trailer.
“When I used to drive a truck, the man who sent me used to be my supervisor. I used to throw the parts in the trash, and he’ll send people to pick it up.”
The state Commander of the Amotekun Corps, Akogun Adetunji Adeleye, disputed the suspect’s story, stating that he killed someone on purpose before detaching the parts after which he buried the victim in a shallow grave.
“We have a suspect in our custody who was caught and arrested with legs and hands of human being wrapped in paper,” Adeleye said.
“Upon interrogation, he took us to where he severed the body of the person killed and hurriedly buried the person in a shallow grave.”
