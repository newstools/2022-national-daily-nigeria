Nigeria’s Super Eagles on Tuesday arrived in Garoua, Cameroon, for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) which starts on Sunday.
The squad is composed of 25 players selected from the 28 players earlier invited by coach Austin Eguavon; though, two defenders, Jamilu Collins and Tyrone Ebuehi, and a striker, Odion Jude Ighalo, are yet to join the team.
The Super Eagles playing in Group D of 2021 AFCON, will take on the Pharaohs of Egypt in their first game on Tuesday.
Nigeria won the tournament last in 2013, after being earlier champions in 1980 and 1994.
