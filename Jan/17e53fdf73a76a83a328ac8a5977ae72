Kebbi State governor, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar Bagudu and the former governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero have taken to tango over the governorship interest of Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.
Abubakar Malami is a citizen of Kebbi State and has been heading Federal Justice ministry since President Muhammadu Buhari’s first tenure in 2015.
Bagudu and Aliero are currently battling for the soul of APC, to supplant their interest in order to have a foothold to plant their anointed candidates in 2023.
The rift, National Daily learnt has made fragile of APC in Kebbi, even as Malami is the choice of governor Atiku to succeed him while Senator Aliero has thrown his support for Nigeria’s Senate leader, Yahaya Abdullahi for the plum job.
Aliero is a two term governor of Kebbi State and currently a Senator.
Abdullahi and Malami were yet to declare their interest, but their supporters in the State have been busy marketing their interest preparatory to the official declaration.
The APC is currently divided into two factions with each faction loyal to Senator Aliero and another to governor Atiku.
A source revealed that each faction wanted to control party structure ahead of election primaries, particularly that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill may not make direct primary compulsory again.
Alhaji Bala Sani Kangiwa, who was removed during the last state congress of the party is the chairman in Senator Aliero’s camp, while the camp of the governor has Abubakar Kana Zuru as chairman. Two secretariats of the APC now exist in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital.
