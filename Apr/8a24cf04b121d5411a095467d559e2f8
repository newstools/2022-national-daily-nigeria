Reactions have trailed the declaration to contest for the 2023 presidential election by a 40-year-old Ibadan-based Muslim cleric Olasupo Afeez Akinola under the banner of the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to the nation, Olasupo noted that God directed him to contest for the post of President, saying that Nigerians are currently in abject poverty, hence the need for a God’s fearing leader to emerge.
Nigerians reacted to the declaration as follows.
Just like what one of those who reacted said ‘this is democracy at play. In a democratic setting like that of Nigeria, anybody that fulfills the constitutional requirements for a political position can vie for such including the post of the president of Nigeria. This Islamic Cleric joining the contest will make the political game in the APC interesting.
Recall that many aspirants including the Vice president of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo, national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the minister of transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi have all previously declared to contest for the same post in the party. Does the cleric have a chance of defeating these political titans?
