Ozonna, the son of the current Governor of Anambra State, Charles Soludo has recently become an internet sensation and has gotten people talking.
Ozonna was born in nigeria but he grew up in America and he is currently based in New-york where he is taking a shot at fame with his music.
His recent photos have drawn some rather unsavory comments from some Facebook users, as one Celestine opined that Charles Soludo cannot manage the state well because of the way his son turned out (WHATEVER THAT MEANS)

This is an evidence that Soludo will not be able to manage Anambra state very well.
Other Facebook users shared the same sentiments, below are some comments
