As Nigeria continues her match toward the 2023 general elections, the race for the office of the president is gradually heating up.
What started as a mere handful of individuals declaring their Interest back in January, has gradually snowballed into a staggering list of presidential aspirants across the country’s top two political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
While the PDP has seen its list of aspirants grow from 7 to 13 in the space of three months, the APC has seen its number of candidates swell from 4 to 7, with former Rivers Governor Rotimi Amaechi, and current Kogi governor, Yahaya Bello becoming the latest political juggernauts to join the race.
From the look of things, however, these numbers might likely increase within the next few weeks as some persons appear to be gearing up to throw their hats into the ring as well. One of such persons could be the current Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele.
For quite some time now, the rumor mill has been rife with stories that the CBN governor is eyeing the seat of his boss, Muhammadu Buhari.
Though a few campaign posters have been sighted across the country, Emefiele’s presidential ambition remained speculation.

Maybe that is why the Special Adviser to the Lagos Governor on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, shared pictures of dozens of space wagon vehicles plastered with Emefiele’s campaign posters.
Taking to his Facebook page, Joe Igbokwe noted that the sheer number of vehicles seen in the pictures is proof that the CBN governor is taking his presidential ambition very seriously.
From the look of things, Emefiele is going all out to clinch the APC’s presidential ticket.
Do you think the CBN Governor stands a chance against seasoned aspirants like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Orji Uzor Kalu?
