In his ruling, Mr Segun Rotiba, the President of the court, said that the court had confirmed all the allegations presented by the petitioner, Mrs Adekambi to be true, and observed that the couple had decided to go on their separate ways.
Rotiba ruled that the respondent, Mr Adekambi, should be responsible for the upkeep and welfare of the three children of the marriage by paying N50,000 on monthly basis.
He added that the respondent would also be paying N50,000 yearly for the accommodation of the children and that both parties would cater for the medical bills of the children.
According to him, the complainant should have custody of the children while the children can spend their school holidays with their father.
Earlier, Mrs Adekambi told the court that the respondent had left his matrimonial home in April 2021, leaving her and the children unattended.
She explained that there was no care for her and her children saying that their relatives had intervened to resolve the rift but there was no reconciliation.
In his response, Mr Adekambi said that he agreed to the dissolution of the marriage since it was the only way he could have peace of mind.
He explained that he would have been the one to file for the divorce suit if not because the complainant did first.
Adekambi, a car dealer, confirmed to have left his matrimonial home for him to have peace and long life.
He urged the court to give the complainant the custody of the children for better upbringing, promising to cater for the children’s welfare.
