Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveJeffrey, the brother of late Christian Tobechukwu Obumseli, who was allegedly stabbed to death by his girlfriend, Courtney Clenney popularly known as Courtney Tailor, a popular Instagram influencer, has pleaded with the public to join his family in seeking justice for his brother.
In a post on his Instagram page, Jeffrey reacted to old tweets of his brother dissing Black women. He said his family strongly disagreed with the “ignorant and repulsive tweets” made by the then high school student.
Jeffrey said the old tweets should not diminish their demand for justice.
He, therefore, called on the members of the Black community to support his family to ensure they get justice as Courtney is being treated differently by the authorities because of her “privilege as a wealthy white woman.”
Jeffrey wrote, “As a family, we strongly disagree with the ignorant and repulsive tweets from my then-high school-aged brother that has recently surfaced. However, the tweets do not diminish our demand for a thorough investigation into Toby’s murder or negate the necessity for justice.
“The bottom line is inextricably clear: Courtney is being treated differently because of her privilege as a wealthy white woman. Within 24 hours following Toby’s death, the detective on the case prematurely concluded this was not a crime of violence.
“We have a long legal battle ahead of us to ensure justice is served. I need your support. My family needs your support. We cannot do this without community.”
