He further explains that they discussed how they can build consensus ahead of the PDP’S presidential primary, to provide fresh leadership that can come up with real solutions for Nigeria’s economy and insecurity issues “At the meeting, we discussed building consensus ahead of the PDP’s presidential primary, to provide fresh leadership that can come up with real solutions for Nigeria’s economic and insecurity issues”
This was the similar step Bola Tinubu took yesterday when he had a closed door meeting with APC Governors ahead of APC primaries.
