Reno Omokri, the popular Nigerian Public Commentator and Human Rights Activist has taken to his social media page to react to the re-arrest of Gloria Okolie who was accused of being a spy for the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).
It will be recalled that Harrison Gwamnishu, an activist who has continuously used his social media platforms to ask that justice be served for Glory Okolie announced her release on his social media page on the 23rd of March 2023.
Omokri who learned about her rearrest and seems not happy about it claimed that “Sheikh Gumi knows the whereabouts of terrorists” and added that he “regularly meets” with the group and wondered why police have not arrested him.
His post read, “21 year old Gloria Okolie has been re-arrested by the Nigerian Police on suspicion on being an IPOB spy. So, why haven’t the Police arrested Sheikh Gumi, a man who knows the whereabouts of terrorists, and regularly meets with them, and advocates for their interests?”
