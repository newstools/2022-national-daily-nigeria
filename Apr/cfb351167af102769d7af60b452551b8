The Imam, during the sermon, urged worshippers and entire Nigerians to play apathy in the forthcoming 2023 general elections if the government fails to fix the security problems and other challenges facing the nation.
The mosque authorities believed the sermon which captured was capable of inciting public outrage.
Reacting, Gumi on Monday condemned the sermon, describing it as “sentiments overriding intellect”.
“It’s a case of sentiments overriding intellect. Calling masses not to vote out incompetent government by massive voting is worst than the few kidnappings and a misplaced judgment,” he said.
