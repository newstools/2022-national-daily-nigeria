Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveThe bodies of at least 20 civilian men have been found lying strewn across the street in the town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area in shocking images released by AFP on Saturday.
Some face down against the pavement, others facing upwards with mouths open.
“Three of them are tangled up in bicycles after taking their final ride, while others, with waxy skin, have fallen next to bullet-ridden and crushed cars,” according to AFP journalists.
One corpse can be seen with his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth.
The Mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the dead civilians had received inhumane treatment at the hands of Russian forces.
“Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white ‘civilian’ rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,” Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak claimed the bodies of the men found with hands tied “were shot dead by Russian soldiers,” in a tweet on Saturday.
“These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat. How many more such cases are happening right now in the occupied territories?”
