Massive fire outbreak engulfed a timber market at Ogba, an outskirt of Ikeja, Lagos, destroying stocks of timber dealers. The National Emergency Management Agency, (NEMA), Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, and fire fighters were said to have battled for several hours to prevent the fire from spreading.
The inferno was said to have started at about 3.30 m in the early hours of Sunday. It was confirmed that no life was lost and there were no injuries, as dealers had closed for business at the time of the fire outbreak.
The cause of the fire could not be ascertained immediately.
