It does not just rain for Chelsea’s Manager, Thomas Tuchel but it pours. The German was present as Chelsea were thrashed at home to Brentford in the EPL on Saturday but recent news on his personal life has not been favourable either.
According to Media reports, the Chelsea Manager is separating from his wife of 13 years after their relationship status went beyond reconciliation which forced his Spouse to start divorce proceedings against Tuchel.The divorce is reportedly going to cost some money with Tuchel’s wife, Sissi and their daughters going to be the major benefactor.
Tuchel was pictured with his wife during Chelsea’s Champions league win over Manchester city last season and they looked happy together. According to reports though, they ought to have splitted a long time ago but tried their best to stay together up until this moment where it was clear for Sissi that she could no longer remain with Tuchel after 13 years of marriage.
