Two Chibok girls who escaped from their Boko Haram abductors when their school in Chibok, Borno state was invaded in 2014, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu will receive master’s degrees from Florida’s Southeastern University on Friday.
On April 14, 2014, 276 pupils of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, were kidnapped by the Boko Haram insurgents. Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu were among a few who were able to escape from the insurgents on the way to captivity. Over 100 of them have not returned.
The abductions spawned a worldwide condemnation and a social media campaign using the phrase, #BringBackOurGirls.
Bishara and Pogu escaped and eventually found refuge in the United States.
