Former Senator from Kaduna State, Shehu Sani, has listed names of known terror leaders who still working free in the country.

According to the former Kaduna central district lawmaker, those terror leaders even go about granting interviews to radio stations and newspapers in Hausa language but cannot be touched.

According to him, characters such as Bello Turji, Dogo Gide, Manjagara and Balleri are the topmost northern Nigeria terror leaders who have been moving around freely, planning and executing terrorist attacks successfully.

“Bello Turji, Dogo Gide, Manjagara and Balleri are the topmost northern terror leaders who have been granting Radio and papers interviews in our Hausa language, but remain illusive for authorities to arrest. I just don’t get it,” Sani tweeted.

He added, “There are 37 villages along Kaduna-Abuja road, if the Government can recruit, arm and engage the youths of these villages to protect the road and the rail track, it ‘ll be cheaper and more effective than blowing N71 Billion in the name of surveillance or whatever ‘solution systems’ they call it.”

Recall that gunmen have recently shelled Nigeria with terror attacks with the country’s leaders looking helpless.

Many passengers were said to have been initially kidnapped during the attack, including Zamfara State former deputy Governor, Mallam Ibrahim Wakkala Liman.
