Engineer Ifeanyi Megafu, the father of Dr Chinelo Megafu, who was killed in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack on March 28, 2022, has said he was devastated when he saw comments on his daughter’s last tweet calling for help during the attack.
Chinelo was one of the passengers attacked on an Abuja-Kaduna train on the night of Monday, March 28, 2022.
“I’m in the train, I have been shot please pray for me,” Chinelo tweeted.
She was, however, trolled for her tweet by some social media users who are mostly supporters of the Nigerian government and members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). They claimed she was lying, while some asked if she was dead yet.
In his first public reaction since the incident, Megafu said he has forgiven the country and those who mocked his daughter’s call for help and the country.
Megafu who spoke at the ongoing funeral service held for Chinelo at the Shepherdhill Baptist Church in Lagos urged those in government to fix this country, “So that we will stop losing our young ones and the best and brightest will not be taken away like Chinelo.”
He added “Chinelo was just inches away from leaving this country to further her studies and go practice in an environment devoid of hate and fear.”
29-year-old Chinelo, the first of her parents’ three children, will be buried in Lagos on Thursday, April 21, 2022.
