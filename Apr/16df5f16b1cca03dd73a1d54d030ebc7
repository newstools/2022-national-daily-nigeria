A Chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Joe Igbokwe, has dragged those who claimed that President Buhari has performed below expectation, referring to such persons as freeloaders.
According to a post he made on his Facebook page earlier today, he made it known that the thieves and freeloaders are saying that President Buhari has failed. He further urged President Buhari not to mind such persons, making known that they will cross the bridge when they get to they get to the bridge.
Speaking further, the APC chieftain stated it clearly that they will show those people who think that Buhari has failed his achievements and force it down to their throats, if need be.
This is really a funny one from Joe Igbokwe. I don’t think that there is any reason why he should force people to believe what he thinks is right. But nevertheless, I really think that Joe Igbokwe is entitled to his own opinion.
