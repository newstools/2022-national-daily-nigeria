A former House of Representatives member, Abdulmumin Jibrin recently took to his Twitter account to advise South West politicians to play politics with smartness. Abdulmumin Jibrin said, “Our southwest APC family, stop these attacks! Where is your political smartness? If not for the fights within you which those against your interest are taking advantage of, southwest should naturally have the right of first refusal for the APC Presidential ticket! CLOSE YOUR RANKS!”
Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin is the coordinator of all registered Tinubu campaign organizations and it is therefore important that South West politicians listen to him. He has rendered his piece of advice to the South West politicians. It looks as if they have a large number of Presidential candidates of APC that are contesting in the 2023 election.
It is important that they form a consensus among themselves and chose the best among them to avoid losing the party’s ticket to another geopolitical zone in Nigeria. The Tinubu and Osinbajo camps are already trading words of political interest that may jeopardize the zones’ opportunity to produce the next president of Nigeria.
