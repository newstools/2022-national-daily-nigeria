It wasn’t a celebration of death. Nor was it a pact.
According to the men of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of Lagos State Police Command who rescued him, it was a string of bad luck that motivated him to end it all.
The man called it a personal challenge.
The challenge made him sell his house, land and car.  His wife left. He got a loan, too. But nothing worked.
He tried harder, got a job. But on the resumption date, he learnt the job had been given to someone else.
“Today being my birthday, I have decided to end it all. The burden and the frustration is too much for me to bear,” he said.
But Bamigboye also failed in the attempt to kill himself.
He has been taken to Adekunle Police Station, where efforts are in progress to contact his family members.
