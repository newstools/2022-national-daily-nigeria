He spoke in Hausa at the Villa on Friday after briefing Buhari on the sstate of victims bombed on an Abuja-bound train on Monday.
“I have complained to Mr. president and I swear to God, if action is not taken, we as governors will take actions to protect the lives of our people.
“If it means deploying foreign mercenaries to come and do the work, we will do it to address these challenges.”
He, however, said the president has assured him that action will be taken to bring an end to terrorism in the next few months.
The governor stated again that the best way to tackle terrorism once and for all was for the Nigerian Armed Forces to bomb forest enclaves where terrorists are hibernating.
“Unless this is done, this problem will persist and it is capable of destroying Nigeria as a whole.”
“These people (terrorists) are getting money. The way they are so emboldened; they fear no authority, no soldier and so why won’t security agents go to their enclaves and kill them all?
“We know where they are, SSS gives reports on them every day, they have their numbers including that of Dogo Gide and what he is planning,” he said.
