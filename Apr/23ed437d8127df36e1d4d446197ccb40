The configuration of the power play since Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday declared his intention to run for the President in 2023 is heating up the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). A Group in Ekiti State, known as Osinbajo Grassroot Organization, on Monday, asserted that the early resistance of the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to the declaration of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN for the 2023 presidential race is unnecessary. Leader of the Osinbajo Grassroot Organization in Ekiti State, Femi Adeleye, declared that Tinubu will end working for Osinbajo at the APC primaries.

The group expressed opposition to the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who convened an emergency meeting with the party’s governors in Abuja, after the declaration for the 2023  presidential election by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The group engaged on Street Walk to the APC Secretariat in Ado-Ekiti, declaring their ‘Belief in the Candidacy of the Vice President to lead the Country from 2023.”
Adeleye declared that “an Osinbajo Presidency is the best option for the APC to bring about Sustainability and Development.”

Adeleye, however, acknowledged that the place of the APC national leader, Tinubu, “cannot be disputed and there is no rivalry of any sort;” he reiterated that “Tinubu will work for the emergence of Professor Yemi Osinbajo at the primaries.”
