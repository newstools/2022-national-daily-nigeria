Punches flew after wards. And the hostilities between the two became contagious among the party leaders.
Addressing our correspondent, the SDP chairman in Owerri zone, Chidiebere Oja, said that the Congress could not go on because they had information that some chieftains of other political parties from the state wanted to implant moles in the party.
“Imo SDP is not for sale. What you saw today is spontaneous combustion of anger by the real members of this party. Those who have worked for years to keep this party alive and moving in the state,” he said.
“They got information that politicians from other political parties from the state want to hijack Imo SDP. We will not allow that to happen.

We will communicate them when we resolve the internal differences and fix a new date.”
Others expressed a similar concern.
The state chairman of the party, Ben Anochie, later addressed the crowd, and declared the Congress suspended.
