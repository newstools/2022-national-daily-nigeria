Igboho, conditionally released until his case is over, now preaches against war—the war he initially threatened before his attempted arrest, evasion, and detention last year.
According to a statement by one of his counsels, Yomi Aliyu (SAN), the Yoruba rights activist called on his supporters, especially his kinsmen at home and in the diaspora to embrace dialogue in their quest for self-determination.
“He continues to preach against war seeing what is happening in Ukraine and some parts of Igboland in Nigeria. He implored all, especially his kinsmen at home and in the diaspora, to embrace dialogue in their quest for self-determination without heating up the very fragile situation in Nigeria,” the statement read in part.
“He believes that their ambition will be achieved without firing a bullet as he used to say at rallies.
“He appreciates Chief Dele Momodu being the only Yorubaman of note that came to visit him in Cotonou prison. He remains grateful to the President of the Republic of Benin, President Talon, for releasing him from prison with a view to uniting him with members of his immediate family, albeit only in Cotonou for the time being.
“He assures all those in support of peaceful self-determination through a referendum that the struggle continues as he will not relent in his efforts in that regard.”
AGF Abubakar Malami said Nigeria will still extradite Igboho to come and face the law since the agitator is still a wanted man in Nigeria.
But Malami said political solution may be considered.
