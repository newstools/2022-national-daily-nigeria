Mr Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, said this at an interactive session with the leadership of the House of Representatives on Tuesday in Abuja.
The minister said the bill would focus on creation and development of the Ministry’s Start-up Eco System.
Pantami also said the bill, when passed, would provide the enabling environment for young entrepreneurs, particularly within the digital eco system to be successful.
He urged the executive and legislative arm to work together to address the challenges facing young innovators and entrepreneur in the country.
He said the bill, when passed, would provide the enabling environment for young entrepreneurs, particularly within the digital eco system to be successful.
He observed that young entrepreneurs in the country were faced with challenges that required government intervention which needed no financial support to eliminate.
“These young entrepreneur’s are not seeking jobs from the government. In fact they are employers not employees.
” So by implication, if we support them, that will go along way in creating many job opportunities for our citizens.
“Because all the start-ups are not in anyway potential job employees but rather potential job providers,” Pantami said.
The minister said government had discovered that many countries had their own start-up apps, which was all about bringing stakeholders to discuss the challenges being confronted by the young innovators/entrepreneurs.
He added that the Federal Government would see what could be done to make them successful.
Rep. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, the House Leader, said interaction was part of the consideration process that would give the bill the opportunity to explain the intent and benefits of the legislative document.
