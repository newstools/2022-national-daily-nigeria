Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in his victory speech on Sunday his re-election sends a message not only to the EU, but also to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“We will remember this victory until the end of our lives because we had to fight against a huge amount of opponents: the local left wing, the international left wing all around, bureaucrats of Brussels, all the money and institutions of the Soros empire, the international mainstream media and the Ukrainian president too. We never had so many opponents at the same time,” he told supporters in Budapest.
Oban is known as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The election campaign was dominated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which put Orban’s lengthy association with Putin under scrutiny.
While Hungary ultimately supported most EU sanctions unveiled so far, Orban has been adamant that measures are not extended to imports of Russian oil and gas. Most of Hungary’s oil and natural gas imports come from Russia.
