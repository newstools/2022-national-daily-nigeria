“On the evening of April 4, sea-based high-precision long-range weapons near the town of Ochakiv destroyed a training center for Ukrainian Special Operations Forces, which was used, among other things, to accommodate foreign mercenaries,” Russian Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said in a statement.
The Russian military describes foreigners who have volunteered to fight for Ukraine as “mercenaries.”
Konashenkov added that Russian forces air-launched precision missiles targeting fuel storage facilities in four locations: In Kremenets, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia and Novomoskovsk.
Russian forces have been hitting fuel supply and storage facilities around Ukraine since the invasion started Feb. 24.
