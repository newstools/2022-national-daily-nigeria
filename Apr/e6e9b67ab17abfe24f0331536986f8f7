According to GhanaWeb, the deceased had demanded the refund of a debt to enable him prepare for school.
Boateng told police that he decided to kill his friend because he couldn’t raise the debt.
It was reported that Boateng lured the victim to his death under the guise of taking pictures of work on a plot of land he claimed his mother bought.
On the piece of land, he struck Gyamfi with a stick and fled.
Police in the Ashanti Region say neighbours who had seen them together earlier raised the alarm, after Gyamfi went missing.
