Nigerian activist, Reno Omokri, has taken to social media to disclose why Nigerian businessman, Aliko Dangote, is recognised as the richest black businessman on planet Earth.
The former aide to Goodluck Jonathan who revealed this through his official Twitter account, stated that Aliko Dangote is the richest black man on Earth because he comes from a very rich family that invest in each other’s businesses.
Reno Omokri further advised Nigerians to emulate the Dantata family if they want to be wealthy like Dangote, adding that they should not get rich and invest their earnings on women.
Reno Omokri finally counseled Nigerians to become wealthy and help their families to drive out poverty from their lives.

Reno Omokri has indeed spoken the truth, as a wealthy man usually has the backings of his family.
Investment in your family will produce more rich people in your circle.
