Femi Fani Kayode also known as FFK the deputy national coordinator of the Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign, in an interview with AIT’s Ijeoma Osamor, disclosed how Governor Yahaya Bello allegedly prevented a ‘civil war’ in Nigeria some months ago, and why he thinks the Kogi State governor will become Nigeria’s next president in 2023
In a video showing the interview, the former Aviation Minister described Yahaya Bello as the only man who can end insecurity and wanton killings in Nigeria just as he has done in Kogi State. He also said Yahaya Bello takes the bull by the horn when it comes to the issue of insecurity and on many occasions, he has gone into the battlefield to encourage security operatives
In response to FFK’s assertion, Ijeoma Osamor inquired to know why Yahaya Bello hasn’t helped his ruling APC to solve the problem of insecurity in Nigeria if he were as capable as FFK portrayed him to be
FFK then alleged that if not for the timely intervention of Yahaya Bello and his team, there would have been another civil war in Nigeria some months ago. He said during the period when northerners placed a blockade of food items transported from northern Nigeria to the southern part, some southerners said they would kill northerners in the south and some northerners said they would kill southerners in the north.
However, Yahaya Bello and his team reached out to the major stakeholders on both sides on the need for peace to reign and he got them to sheath their swords. FFK said “Yahaya Bello negotiated with both sides and ended the food embargo, he ensured there was no civil war and there were no killings.
FFK said he knew about this incident because he was part of Yahaya Bello’s team and it was also published on Vanguard. He also said it was from that moment he knew that Yahaya Bello was the kind of leader Nigeria needed to prosper.
On Yahaya Bello’s presidential ambition, FFK said he (Yahaya) is the best candidate and would win the presidential ticket of the APC no matter the type of presidential primary election the APC adopts. He also said that Time and Chance made Yahaya Bello the governor of Kogi State and Time and Chance will make him the next president of Nigeria so that he will replicate what he did in Kogi State.
