Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 general elections, at a consultation meeting with members of the PDP National Working Committee (NWC), said that he is the best candidate to win the party’s primary election and the main presidential election in 2023. Atiku, presenting his candidacy to the NWC, and seeking the support of the members, declared that “if the PDP is looking for the best candidate that would not only win the primaries, but will trump any opponent at the secondary presidential election, they don’t need to look any further.

“I am the best candidate on account of my experience, my capacity and being a unifier.”

Reference was made to the 2019 presidential election when Atiku, as the PDP candidate, got over 11 million votes. This is an indication that Atiku is worth over 11 million votes before the commencement of the campaign for the 2023 presidential election, which no other presidential aspirant has in the country, except former President Goodluck Jonathan, when he declares.
