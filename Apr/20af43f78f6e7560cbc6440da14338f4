Nigeria’s Super Eagles had failed to qualify on Tuesday after a 1-1 draw with arch-rivals, Ghana.
Davido had revealed his feature on the World Cup theme song, Hayya Hayya (Better Together), on Friday, sparking a superiority contest among fans of Nigerian musicians.
It later degenerated into Davido tweeting “Me versus the music industry! I love it.”
Wading into the conversation on Sunday, Basketmouth hailed Davido for the feat and said he should be applauded.
He said, “In addition to his numerous achievements at such a young age, Davido has now singlehandedly carried Nigeria to the World Cup.
“That alone should be applauded, regardless of any other situation. Nobody go die if we support everybody.”
