A governorship aspirant in Plateau State, Amb. Yohanna Margif has said the reoccurring insecurity menace that has engulfed the State for over two decades will be a thing of the past if elected governor.
Margif said Plateau State remain a very suitable business and investment hub if government vigorously address some of the major security challenges in the State by tackling their root causes.
Margif was speaking on Saturday in Jos, at an event where he declared his interest to contest the 2023 governorship election in the State.
He told the gathering that if the security challenges in Plateau is completely eradicated, there will be economic harvest that will attract both local and international investors.
According to him: “If elected I will address major issues that border on religion, injustice and ethnicity which are usually the triggers or fault lines exploited during any misunderstanding by groups or individuals.
“I will achieve this through dialogue, consultation and collaboration where threats to security will be addressed before they reach violent dimensions”.
In addition, the governorship aspirant said he will face headlong acts of criminality through support from security agencies and will assist them with equipment and other logistics for better response to security demands.
Margif said other things Plateau people will benefit from him are Social investment program to a full-scale social welfare scheme for the less privileged people and senior citizens, Reforming the educational system for relevance to meet the challenge of the 21st century, among others.
