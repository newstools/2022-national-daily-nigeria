An ace journalist named Babajide Kolade Otitoju (BKO) revealed, in a recent interview with Ibraheem Shitta of TVC News, why he prefers a young Nigerian President to an old one.
Babajide Kolade Otitoju said, “I look forward to seeing a youth as Nigeria’s President because they are mountain movers and world shakers. Youths are created with first class ideas.”
Babajide Kolade Otitoju used Kingsley Moghalu for an instance saying, “a Kingsley Moghalu’s thinking will definitely be different from an old man’s thinking. Without Being president, he has even innovated something we are all using till date.”
He hinted that before a youth will become the president of Nigeria, the current political structure needs to fade. The reason behind this according to the journalist is because the current structure will never accommodate the youths to the point of becoming the president.
Lastly, the well known Journalist said, “I strongly hope and wish I will be alive to witness the day a youth will control the affairs of Nigeria.”
Dear esteemed Readers, do you also think a young President will perform more better than an old Nigerian president? If yes, why?
