Bandits and other criminals have been operating in the north and south of the country in what appeared like a resurgence.
The terrorist attack on an Abuja-bound train in Kaduna on Monday became the valve that gave way to angst across the nation.
Nine persons were killed, 21 passengers were declared missing after terrorists bombed the train, which was 30 minutes away from its destination.
Obasanjo described the attack as a “serious situation.”
He spoke at his penthouse residence, Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while receiving a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Dr Ugochukwu Williams, and his team.
“Nigerians are no longer safe on the road, in the train and at the airport,” he said, calling for a concerted effort of stakeholders to stem the tide .
“So, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say ‘you’re welcome’. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation where one man will say yes, he has a solution, unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.
“I believe that all right thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.”
