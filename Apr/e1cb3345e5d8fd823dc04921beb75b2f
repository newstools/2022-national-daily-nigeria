A governorship aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Otunba Jimi Adebisi Lawal (JAL) has rejoiced with Muslims on the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan.

According to reports, the yearly holy month of Ramadan, which is marked by dawn-to-dusk abstinence from food and drink, begins tomorrow, Saturday, 2nd April, 2022.

In a statement he issued in Abeokuta, the British-trained banker, lawyer and public servant said, “The commencement of this year’s Ramadan is significant in many ways for us as a people and a nation. It coincides with the preparations for leadership change across all levels.

“Therefore, this year’s holy month of Ramadan offers us a golden opportunity as a people and a nation to seek the face of the Almighty Allah to guide us in making the right choice of leaders.

“We should use the opportunity of this season of spiritual reflection and growth to rededicate ourselves to nation building and love for the common man.

“As we abstain from all vices in this holy month of Ramadan, let us make pious living and discipline a way of life, going forward. As a people and a nation, we must commit ourselves to ennobling virtues that would make our immediate environment, the nation and the world at large a better place than we met it. The holy month of Ramadan gives us a lunch pad to these virtues and we must latch on to it.”

The governorship hopeful also enjoined the Muslim faithful to ensure that they use the period to show love and care to others, especially the poor and needy.
