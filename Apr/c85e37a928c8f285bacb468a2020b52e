Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin spoke separately on the Rossiya 24 state TV channel on Monday, asking the British government for help to be brought home in exchange for Viktor Medvedchuk, a wealthy Ukrainian close to Russian President Vladimir Putin who was recently arrested by Kyiv.
“I understand the situation,” Pinner said in the video. “I’d like to appeal to the government to send me back home, I’d like to see my wife again.”
Pinner made a direct appeal to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his and Aslin’s behalf, saying “obviously I would really appreciate your help in this matter.”
It was unclear how freely Pinner and Aslin were able to talk, as they appeared to be prompted by an unidentified man.
The man showed them a video of Medvedchuk’s wife, Oksana, making an appeal over the weekend for her husband to be swapped with them.
“I think that Boris needs to listen to what Oksana has said,” said a nervous-looking Aslin, calling the British PM by name. “If [he] really does care about British citizens like he says he does then he will help.”
Both men fought on the Ukrainian side in Mariupol, which is now almost entirely under Russian control.
