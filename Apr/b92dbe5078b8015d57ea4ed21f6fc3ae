Shehu Sani a former Senator from Kaduna central was on his Twitter account to react after kidnappers of the Innocent train passengers place calls to the families of their hostages without being intercepted.
Shehu Sani, stated that the train kidnappers are freely making calls to the families of their hostages, as a result of this unpleasant development, Shehu Sani asked what happened to the SIM card registration and NIN.
Shehu Sani has made a valid point here, the factors mentioned above are tools that could be easily used to trace the perpetrators of the train attacks but nobody seems to be talking about that option at all. We all know that when a SIM card is purchased in Nigeria it has to be registered with the details of whoever is purchasing the SIM, a photo of the person is also taken during registration, the introduction of linking SIM cards with NIN numbers has also made it easy to trace SIM card owners, so why are these kidnappers and terrorists placing calls freely to people without being intercepted or traced?.
