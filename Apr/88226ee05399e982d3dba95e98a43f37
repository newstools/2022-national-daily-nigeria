Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, on Thursday, at the Executive Council chamber of the Government House, Abeokuta, received nomination and expression of interest forms purchased at N50 million from his supporters under the aegis of Dapo Abiodun Mandate Group.
Governor Abiodun thanked the group for believing in him, assuring that he will not betray the trust and confidence they have in him.
The Dapo Abiodun Mandate Group had earlier passed a vote of confidence on the governor for his leadership style, which according to the group has continued to impact positively on the social, economic and political development of Ogun State.
The governor, thereafter, formally declared to seek re-election for a second tenure on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. Governor Abiodun also disclosed that he will retain the Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako Oyedele, as his running mate.
Governor Abiodun, on his Facebook page, subsequently wrote: “Today, I formally declared my intention to run for a second term in office, and I also announced that I will be running with my deputy, Engr. Noimot Salako Oyedele.
“This was during the presentation of my nomination form by the DA Mandate Group to me. The DA Mandate Group, led by Apagun Biyi Adeleye, had raised funds for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for my second term bid.
“With the support of the good citizens and residents of our dear State, we must sustain the #BuildingOurFuture Together Agenda by doing all that is reasonably within our reach towards ensuring that we provide focused and qualitative governance for everyone.”
