Mary Atule, 38, prepared her master’s dinner, and was ready to go back home when a guard and his accomplice forced their way in to rob Igbas March 31. He, however, was away for political matters.
But Atule recognized one of the criminals: Atiku.
Which again complicated matters.
The robbers then killed the cook, slit her throat, dumped her in a wardrobe, and fled.
According to Igbas, the police said the murder took place in his house, so he had to stay with them.
“One of the suspects is a guard to a high-profile politician who lives along Uwalor Road and also happens to be a relation to the boy who resides at my security post while the second one is also a guard in a house down my street. We need to be careful about the kind of people we employ as security guards in our homes,” he told the Punch.
The state police command spokesman Kontongs Bello, said two suspects are in  custody.
“The gatekeeper identified as Timothy was part of the persons that carried out the murder. It was his brother that was involved in it. It was the gateman that led the police to his brother and one other that masterminded the killing of the (former) lawmaker’s cook to make the arrest. He (Igbas) was detained initially but he has been released.”
