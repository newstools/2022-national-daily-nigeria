A blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger to transfer ownership, record transactions, track assets, and ensure transparency, security, trust and value exchanges in various types of transactions with digital assets.
Furthermore distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a traditional ledger).
Blockchain organizes data into blocks, which are chained together in an append only mode.
