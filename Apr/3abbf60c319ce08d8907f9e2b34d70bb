Human rights activist, Chief Asari-Dokubo, has spoken concerning Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Lagos State. Dokubo addressed the former governor’s Presidential aspiration on Arise News while discussing the 2023 Presidential election.

Asari-Dokubo recently spoke concerning the issues behind oil theft and oil vandalism affecting the Nigeria Delta region. Dokubo pointed out the need to improve security and monitoring activities impacting the oil pipelines.

Addressing Bola Tinubu’s aspiration, Dokubo said, “Some of these Presidential aspirants are former governors. Only Bola Tinubu can claim to have transformed his state, and he has the pedigree. However, he is from the South West. Lagos State is the only state working in Nigeria, and Bola Tinubu built the state. Bola Tinubu is ‘old and ‘sick’ Can Nigeria afford such a President? Why will former governors from other states who left nothing tangible behind aspire to become Nigeria’s President?”
Dokubo clamored that Nigeria’s next President should emerge from the South East.
