Ohaneze Ndigbo, the youth wing, made this statement Friday as security problem worsens in the virgin tenure of the just-sworn-in APGA governor, in spite of the amnesty and other conciliatory moves he has made.
In a statement made available to journalists on Friday, the President-General of Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike said Soludo was worsening the situation by his unguarded utterances.
“One should have expected the Governor to first study the situation and begin to engage diplomatic moves than his quick orders on sit-at-home and amnesty for the agitators,” said Nnabuike.
He called on Governor Soludo to restrain his steps to prevent more avoidable damage from befalling the State.
“At this moment, we expect Prof. Soludo to talk less and do more of engagement. Letting his mouth open at every slightest opportunity would not do Anambra State and indeed the South-East any good.
“The only amnesty is to collaborate with his colleagues and other south-east leaders in their push to get a political solution to this problem and see to the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from detention,” Okwu said.
