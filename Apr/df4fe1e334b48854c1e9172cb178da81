Mella, the ex of Abdulrasheed Bello, popularly known as JJC Skillz, and husband to popular Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele-Bello, has revealed the faces of their twins.



The couple had kept the faces of the twins away from the media since they were born.


However, in a post on Instagram, Mella posted a family photograph showing the twins’ faces.




She wrote, “If you don’t want me to expose your family, then don’t expose mine.”



This is coming days after JJC Skillz debunked rumours suggesting that their marriage is going through some difficulties.
