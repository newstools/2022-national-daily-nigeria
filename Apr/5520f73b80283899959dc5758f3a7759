Three persons have been reportedly killed as armed members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) unleashed mayhem in the Fagba area of Lagos State on Monday morning.
It would be recalled that the Lagos State Chairman of the Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN), Alhaji Azeez Abiola, popularly known as Istijabah had earlier alerted security operatives of an imminent danger in the state.
In the statement, members of TOOAN accused Alh. Musiliu Akinsanya a.k.a MC Oluomo of planning to forcefully takeover some parks in the state, warning that the action would be resisted.
They called on the Inspector General of Police and Lagos State Police Commissioner to take necessary action to prevent the breakdown of peace and order in the state.

The group accused MC Oluomo of planning to cause mayhem in Alimosho, Ifako-Ijaye and other parts of Lagos State on Monday April 11, 2022, in a bid to forcefully take over parks in the areas.
Istijabah had been involved in a leadership tussle since the start of the year, with Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo, the suspended Lagos State Chairman of the NURTW.
Istijabah’s TOOAN is a sub-component of NURTW in Lagos State. While MC Oluomo wants to have total control of TOOAN, Istijabah and his followers feel they should have their autonomy.
His fears have now been confirmed as reports reaching this newspaper indicate that people have been killed by NURTW thugs on Monday morning. A tricycle was also burnt.
It would be recalled that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, recently approved the appointment of MC Oluomo, as the Chairman of parks management committee in the state.
Police officers have arrived at the scene, and have kept the situation under control.
