N’golo Kante, a Chelsea midfielder, has suffered an ankle injury and will miss the rest of the season after being substituted in the second half of the Blues’ Premier League encounter against Brentford.
N’golo Kante struggled to play with injury in the game due to an ankle injury he sustained during the international break with France. N’golo Kante wasn’t fully fit, but he played with injury in the game against Brentford, and he is now set to miss the rest of the season.
Chelsea will face Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League quarter final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday, and N’golo Kante, their greatest defensive midfielder, will be missing.
Because N’golo Kante is Chelsea’s only defensive midfielder, Mateo Kovacic or Ruben Loftus Cheek will have to make a sacrifice and play in Kante’s place. what do you have to say about this? you can share and drop your comments as well thank you.
