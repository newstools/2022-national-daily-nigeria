The Baton Rouge Police in the United States have arrested a 53-year-old woman, Roxanne Record, and her daughter, Kadjah Record, 29, after the pair allegedly gave Record’s four-year-old girl whiskey which resulted in her death.
The police said in a first information report on Saturday that the grandmother allegedly forced the toddler to drink a bottle of whiskey while her mother watched.
The police spokesman, Sgt. L’Jean McKneely, told news outlets the little girl’s grandmother, Roxanne and mother, Kadjah, were arrested on Friday, each on a charge of first-degree murder.

“Officers were sent to a Baton Rouge home around 11 a.m. Thursday after reports of an unresponsive child. The child, 4-year-old China Record, was pronounced dead at the scene,” McKneely said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office said an autopsy showed the cause of death was acute alcohol poisoning after it was discovered that the little girl had a blood-alcohol level of .680%, more than eight times the .08% driving limit for an adult, the police spokesman said.
“While investigating, detectives learned the victim’s grandmother forced her to drink a bottle of the alcohol while the mother watched,” he added.
