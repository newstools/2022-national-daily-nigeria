Bola Tinubu, presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says young Nigerians cannot be blamed for being “lazy” with erratic electricity supply in the country.
Tinubu spoke on Saturday at a rally of southwest youths of the ruling party. Speaking at the rally, Tinubu said no nation can witness “rapid development” without electricity, adding that the country cannot continue to give “excuses” for failure to generate a stable power supply.


Finally, it seems Tinubu has got the message that Buhari and his cabal don’t want him. The gloves are off. So much for the man who said he did not want to step on Buhari’s toes but wanted to wear his shoes. Now, he is not only stepping on Buhari’s toes he is stabbing Buhari, Fashola, and the whole government at the back. Fashola failed as the power minister among the failures in other portfolios held.
But Nigerians should ask Tinubu what he did for the youths of Lagos as the governor for 8 years and as the godfather for about 23 years? Did he provide for the Lagos state youths portable water in their homes if they have homes? Did he build any water treatment plants? How many hospitals did he build? Did he build any sewage treatment plants? How many affordable homes? Why are many of the youths and their parents defecating openly on the streets and under the bridges?
How many schools did he build as the governor? Where are the organized apprenticeship schemes for the Lagos youths? Where are the trade centers or new polytechnics? How long does it take to provide metro/rail services for transportation? How about river transport? How did Tinubu promote the fishing industries on the vast water resources of Lagos state? While he takes Buhari to task, you should answer all these questions.
