Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has continued to enlighten telecommunication subscribers on reasons some do experience data depletions.
In a video message, NCC advised users of telecom services on to manage their data.
Yes, for many of us who complain or experience data depletion, it is important that you apply these tips to turn the situation around; so your data can last longer.
The commission mentioned video streaming quality from video sites such as YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and Showtime as one of the fastest way of draining data.
According to NCC, your smartphone’s default settings are typically configured to get the best possible experience, which comes at the cost of your data usage.
“You can change those settings to manage your data usage in the following ways:
By Manually Capping Mobile Data: To do this, Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage > Billing Cycle. By manually setting Data Saver. Activate data saver: Locate “Data Usage” on your device and activate “Data Saver”.
“This will help cut down your data usage by preventing apps from using data in the background. Disable auto-update on your App store.
