Since 2019, Sheu Sani has been a ferocious critic of the Buhari-led administration as well as the Kaduna State government under Nasir El-Rufai.
He had on several occasions also vowed to rid Kaduna of terrorism should he get the mandate to lead the state.
He once wrote: “We can’t continue to fold our hands while the government is helpless. We must unite the people against terror. Kaduna has never been more divided along religious lines than it is today.
“Only justice, equity and fairness will unite the country. If the governor’s formula was working, he could have united the people”, he added.
