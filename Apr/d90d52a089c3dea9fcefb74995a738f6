Reno Omokri has reacted after Chris Ngige revealed what will happen just two years if he is elected the president of Nigeria. The minister of Labour and employment and former Governor of Anambra state said if he becomes president, Nigerians will begin to feel it in two years.

Reno Omokri while reacting to the statement of the Labour minister said “for 7 years Ngige has been Nigeria’s longest serving Labour minister. And we have seen his impact. ASUU on strike. Doctors on strike. Teachers on strike. May thunder not strike Ngige”
Chris Ngige who is the minister of Labour and employment has declared his interest to run for the office of the president under the umbrella of the All Progressive Congress, APC. Being a serving minister, Ngige is also a member of the ruling party.
Ngige said Nigerians will begin to feel his impact after just two years if he is elected the president. Reno Omokri is wondering why the same impact is not being felt in the sectors overseen by the minister.
