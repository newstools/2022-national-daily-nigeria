The Police Public Relations Officer of the Oyo State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso, has said that investigations have begun into the alleged assault by one Taofeek Gbolagade on his pregnant wife.
Gbolagade was said to have descended on his wife at their residence in the Ogbere Housing Estate, Ibadan, in the early hours of Tuesday.
The temperamental husband, it was gathered, had beaten his pregnant wife over Sahur, the pre-dawn meal usually taken by Muslims in preparation for fasting during Ramadan.
He alleged that the meal was not prepared on time and thereby beat the hapless pregnant wife for over 30 minutes before she managed to escape and leave the house.
The incident was said to have been reported to the police by her family members.
A neighbour confirmed that Gbolagade was fond of beating his wife over any little misunderstanding.
“He did not mind that the wife was pregnant. He reportedly beat her for close to 30 minutes and was crying. She eventually escaped and fled to her parents’ house.
