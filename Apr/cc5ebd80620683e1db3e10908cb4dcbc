A presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, during his mobilization campaign visit to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and APC stakeholders in the state on Monday declared that it will be a betrayal to the country not to accept to serve Nigeria after many citizens have called on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.
Osinbajo was of the view that his experiences in government over the years, including his present position, have given him the needed capacity to govern the country.  He pointed out the need to make things better through good leadership and stop people from dying in the country.
Osinbajo had stated: “Many people are dying for the country every day. If with all that has been given to me by the grace of God — all the experience — I now retire to Lagos or Ikenne to go and write my memoir, it would be a great injustice to this country.
“Now, the opportunity has come, with the experience that I have, the connection and contacts that I have both locally and internationally, it will be a betrayal to the country not to accept to serve the country.
“Nobody can be anything without the endorsement of God. I declare my intention based on the fact that I have served for over seven months as acting president. I was given very serious responsibility as an acting president.”
Governor Akeredolu stated the Ondo delegates love and respect the vice president but noted that it is God Who makes leaders.
