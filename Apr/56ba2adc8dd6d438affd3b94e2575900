Fury retained his WBC heavyweight title in front of 94,000 at Wembley Stadium.
Tyson Fury used his reach advantage to land one jab after another, with particular effectiveness connecting to the body. Whyte was unable to land more than one punch at a time and still could not get close to Fury, although the cut above his right eye stopped bleeding thanks to good work from his cut man between rounds.
Dllian Whyte had a cut open above his right eye during a head butt, and referee Mark Lyson had to separate the two and reprimand each fighter for failing to heed his order to go to neutral corners.
