Agitating for Igbo presidency has been one of the most discuss topic in Nigeria so far, as many people especially in the south East, like Ohanaeze and some politicians stand the ground that, it is the right time for Igbo people to produce the next president of Nigeria as they have not rule this country for the long period of time.
however, two prominent northern elders, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, who is the chairman of Northern Elders Council (NEC) and Mr. Anthony Sani of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) gives two strong advice to the Igbo ahead the agitations which they may or not follow.
What are the 2 strong advice of Northern elders to the Igbo people over Igbo presidency.
Firstly, the northern elders make it known that Igbo people should not see this presidential race of 2023 as do or die for them. they suggest that this presidential race is not the end of time or last chance.
they advice the Igbo people that, they have the right to rule Nigeria just like everyone and if they fail to do it this time, they might do it another time.
The second advice of the northern elders is that The Igbo people should stop the use of force or threatening the unity of Nigeria to get the presidential seat, and play their game in a way that would give them what they want by linking up and building bridge with other region of the country.
According to the constitution, one must win 24 states in order to become the president of Nigeria and non of the south or northern region have 24 states, which shows we will always need each other to rule this country.
