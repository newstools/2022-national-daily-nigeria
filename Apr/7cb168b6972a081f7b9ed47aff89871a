The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has described Monday’s declaration by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to succeed his boss in 2023 as a welcome development that will offer Nigerian voters a fresh insight into the administration.
HURIWA stated this on Monday through a statement issued by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in the aftermath of Osinbajo’s declaration to run for the Presidency.
“We believe that if the VP successfully dethrones his political godfather Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and wins the ticket of his political party, the voters will have the best opportunities of our lifetime to learn hard lessons on how not to govern a multi Ethnic and multi religiously diverse nation like Nigeria.

“We think his winning the ticket may offer Nigerians a beautiful opportunity for perfect pay back, a sweet revenge by sending to him the message that he served as the Vice president to a President that created more divisions than he met them”.
“The entry of the Vice President into the presidential race should be seen as an opportunity to get firsthand information from the man who presumably may have seen it all to inform Nigerians why the administration literally took Nigeria and Nigerians from top to bottom in all areas of our National life including economy, security, social welfare and external indebtedness.”
HURIWA recalled that in stepping into the fray to run for the office of President to succeed his boss, the current Vice president had stated thus: “For the past seven (7) years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, President Muhammadu Buhari.
“In these 7 years, while on the train of duty and service, I traversed every part of our country, meeting Nigerians of every cadre, class, tribe and walks of life, both young and old; I MET YOU.

HURIWA however thinks that since he now wants to succeed his boss, there are areas and milestones that have been left untouched and that this is a signal that the Vice President is unsatisfied by the performance that both himself and his boss have offered to Nigerians which is why he now wants to repeat a tenure or two to be able to realise those unachievable milestones.
