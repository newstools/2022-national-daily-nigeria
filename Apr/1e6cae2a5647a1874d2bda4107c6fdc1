A few days ago, the vice president of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo declare his intention to contest in the next presidential election that is scheduled to hold next year. Quite a lot of people that read the news have something to say about Professor Yemi Osinbajo’s aspiration.
Recently, a popular human rights activist, lawyer and renowned book author, Reno Omokri, took to his verified Twitter page to slam people that say Professor Yemi is powerless.
On his page, Reno Omokri said “People saying VP Osinbajo is powerless are ignorant. Obasanjo was military vice to Murtala. When Murtala did something Obasanjo found unconscionable, Obasanjo physically confronted Murtala. TY Danjuma separated them. Obasanjo and Danjuma are still alive. Google it!”
According to Reno Omokri’s tweet, he likened the issue between Yemi Osinbajo and President Buhari to what happened during a military regime when Olusegun Obasanjo was the military vice to General Muritala Muhammed. He tentatively said, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is as powerful as the President of the country. Reno Omokri is indirectly saying it is the Vice president’s choice to remain silent over some decisions made by President Buhari.
Reno Omokri’s tweet was borne out of the rumour that is flying around the country that the Vice president’s hands are tight concerning the whole issue happening in Nigeria, Reno Omokri conclusive said those carrying this mentality are ignorant People.
See how some Twitter users reacted to the tweet now;
