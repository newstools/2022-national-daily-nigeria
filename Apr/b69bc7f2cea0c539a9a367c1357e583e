A 67-year old man who was prevented from committing suicide on the 3rd Mainland Bridge on Tuesday by operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) has opened up on why he decided to take his life.
The elderly man, who gave his name as Oluwatoye Bamgboye, from Oju – Ore, Ogun State, was attempting to jump into the Lagos Lagoon inward Lagos Island when the officers stopped him.
He disclosed that a personal challenge made him sell his house, land and car. With that, he still couldn’t solve the problem. He got a loan and the problem still persisted.
He explained further that he secured a job and on the resumption date, he was informed that the job had been given to someone else.
