A few hours ago, a popular Nigerian politician and staunch member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media to react to the news that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the alleged owner of a company called “Alphabeta” In Lagos State.
Joe Igbokwe said that a lot of people are complaining that Bola Ahmed Tinubu owns Alphabeta and they alleged that he is using it to extort money from the people in Lagos. He added that Alphabeta has its branches across Nigeria and abroad as he affirmed that the firm has even increased the Lagos State IGR from N500 million to over N40 billion but people are still accusing Tinubu that he is using the firm to make more money for himself. Joe Igbokwe, however, said that is Tinubu also gaining from the Alphabeta in the other PDP States? As he noted that every time Tinubu tries to take Lagos State up, people always bring it down just like they destroy the Lekki tollgate.

According to Joe Igbokwe, he said: “Wailers and speculations said Tinunu owns Alphabeta and he is using it to milk Lagos. Alphabeta consults for Abia, Akwa-Ibom, Sokoto, Bayelsa, Imo, Plateau, Nasarawa, etc. They are even outside Nigeria, is Tinubu milking PDP States too? How can a firm that increases Lagos IGR from N500 million to over N40 billion  today, be milking Lagos? What kind of upside-down thinkers are these? Everything that takes Lagos up, those people always want to bring it down, that was the reason they destroy the Lekki tollgate. I sincerely pray that God will have mercy on you, especially those that are genuinely ignorant”.

Looking at what Joe Igbokwe said, he believes that people want Tinubu to fail which is why they are accusing him of extortion in Lagos State.
What is your take on this issue?
Do you think that Tinubu is the owner of Alphabeta in Lagos?
