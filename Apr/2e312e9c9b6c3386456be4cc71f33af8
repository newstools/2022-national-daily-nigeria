A middle-aged man was killed on Monday night after what begun as a domestic fight between him and his wife took an unexpected turn. According to the DCI sources, the man who has since been identified as Mr. Fabian Omanyala was assaulting his wife when the poor lady escaped and ran to a neighbor’s house for help.


Out of rage, Omanyala followed his wife to the neighbor’s house and decided to once again unleash violence on the lady there. Little did he know that the man of the house was going to swing in action to at least save the lady from the kicks and blows?
The neighbor who has been identified as Mr. Robert Amukule decided to combat the enraged man in order to protect the 53-year-old lady. He took a catapult, aimed at Omanyala and hit him on the forehead.
Omanyala is said to have felt unconscious instantly. As the event took a more tragic turn, the Kakemer villagers who were now arriving at the scene tried to help Omanyala by taking him to the hospital but he died before getting any proper medication.
The DCI has further revealed that the murder suspect Mr. Amukule has now gone into hiding as manhunt is launched by the Teso Police to bring him to justice.
