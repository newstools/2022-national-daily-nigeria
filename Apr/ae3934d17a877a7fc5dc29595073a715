Hon.Desmond Elliott a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly,elated by the recent favourable disposition of the National Executive Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  to the youths, yielding to aspirants within 40 years and below age bracket 50 percent discount.

He opined that the gesture will ease the purchase of party’s nomination forms and encourage youthful participation in partisan politics.

Desmond who represents Surulere Constituency I doubles as the House Committee Chairman on Environment, Parastatal and Agencies, made the comment in a chat with newsmen today, that a whole 50% slash for aspiring  youths is heart-warming and will have a ripple effect in more youthful commitment to the party.

“It is a welcomed development though unprecedented in the history of APC.

“The discount afforded the youths is a step in the right direction and it is clearly a waver by the new order to grow the party more.

“I must state that this signals the fact that our party’s future is secured as more youths take active part in our polity.

“It needs no gain saying that the party’s NEC deserves commendation for this step in the right direction, as the youth makes 65 percent of our demography, we cannot afford to ignore their strength.

“This also shows that the leadership of our party has a listening ear.

“Not quite long after the National Youth Parliament made a case that discount be given to aspiring youths to encourage them take active part in the political process, the party’s NEC heeded their call.

“The ingenuity of the youths will no doubt bring about a much more vibrant APC and it is a good omen for us.” Elliott said.
