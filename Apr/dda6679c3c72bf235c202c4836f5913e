Just recently, Human right activist, author, politician, political critic and senator, Shehu Sani reacted after an African American Man; Joaquin Ciria, who spent 32 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit is freed after he was exonerated.
Reacting to the bittersweet news, Shehu Sani wrote the word ‘Tragic’, implying it is really sad to read about a man who spent more than three decades in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.


Joaquin Ciria, a 61-year-old man spent more than half his life in prison for the murder of his friend in San Francisco, a crime he has always said he didn’t commit. The 61-year-old was convicted of murdering his friend; Felix Bastarrica in 1991. It was revealed that there was no physical evidence connecting Ciria to the murder of his friend, but the San Francisco police inspectors focused on him. However he was found innocent after 32 years behind bars after no physical evidence showed that he indeed committed the murder.
