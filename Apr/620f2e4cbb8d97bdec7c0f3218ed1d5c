According to sources, the bandits working in cahoots with Boko Haram want prisoner swaps.
A senior official said the bandits have made contact (with the government) but the issue now involves the Interpol because they have international collaborators.
“Security operatives are working to identify their connection to Boko Haram,” the Punch quoted the official as saying.
“The bandits are after their people who are in custody. They are demanding the release of 16 sponsors and commanders in exchange for the abducted train passengers. That’s why they said in a video that the government knows what they want.”
“We arrested some of their commanders and those sponsoring them in Dubai and Nigeria. We have about 16 commanders and sponsors in custody, so they are demanding their release because their sources of funding are declining.
“I hope the authorities would not release the commanders and sponsors to them because we are getting information on the bandits from the suspects,” the source noted.
 
The railway authorities said more than 160 people culd not be accounted for why eight people died in the attack.
Among the captives seen in the video the terrorists released on Sunday was Bank of Agric’s MD Alwan Hassan released because of his age.
