The commissioner, Ify Obinabo, narrated the incident on Sunday, describing the mother-child bond between the two, despite the mental state of the woman.
“Nothing must happen to my baby. If I look for that baby and fail to find her, I will deal with all of you,” the mother was heard shouting in a video the commissioner uploaded online.
The commissioner said ‘the mentally challenged, beautiful young woman fought tooth and nail to ensure the protection of her baby’.
“The expression was witnessed today (Sunday) at the Women Development Centre Awka, when social workers at the Ministry of Women and Social Welfare tried to separate the mentally challenged woman from her newborn baby,” she added.
“The separation became necessary so that the woman could be taken to a home for the mentally challenged for care and her daughter to a children’s home.”
Social workers were able to take the two apart for special care, and the nursing mum accepted to follow them.
