The beauty entrepreneur and her lover had announced that they were both expecting a child in January.
In her recent interview for the cover of Vogue Magazine’s May edition, Rihanna revealed that her relationship with her boyfriend started off as them just being friends and people barely get out of the friend zone with her.
However, in Rocky’s case, the singer revealed she let down her guards with time.
She said, “People don’t get out of the friend zone very easily with me, And I certainly took a while to get over how much I know him and how much he knows me because we also know how much trouble we can land each other in.”
“Gradually, I let my guard down, and things became serious when the world went into COVID lockdown. He became my family in that time,” she says.”
Speaking on what she loves about the rapper, “What I love the most about us? Transparency with everything: how we’re feeling, what our goals are, what our fears and insecurities are. The vulnerability to be able to say what you feel about each other.”
