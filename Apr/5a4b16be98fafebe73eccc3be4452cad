There are thousands of different species of trees in the world and each one of them has a different money value. The African Blackwood, scientifically known as Dalbergia melanoxylon is considered the most expensive wood in the world. This flowering tree mostly grown in seasonally dry areas is a flowering plant. It is found in several parts of Africa which include Senegal, Eritrea, South Africa, South to Northeastern parts of Africa and many other regions.
The tree is expensive because of its quality. It is used in the manufacture of musical instruments which explains why violins and guitars cost very expensive. The population of the Blackwood has been threatened by over harvesting which has led to people harvesting under matured trees.
The tree is among the small size tree species growing only to about 4-15 m in height when mature. It has a grey bark and shoots that are spiny given it is native to dry areas. How much does the tree cost that it is considered the most expensive tree in the world? A kilogram of Blackwood costs $10,000.
There is need for Africa to plan protection mechanisms to ensure the tree does not become extinct and loose our biodiversity. Follow the page for more news updates daily.
