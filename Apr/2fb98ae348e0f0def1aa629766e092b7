The Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau, NCC, Efosa Idehen, said operators are to ensure strict compliance when registering their customers.
Idehen said SIM card owners also have the responsibility to be vigilant to ensure that they are properly captured either for new SIM activation or SIM replacement.
He said, “As the telecom regulator in Nigeria, our role is to enforce compliance with the extant SIM activation and replacement procedures in order to avoid problems that may arise in the event of stolen, lost, damaged SIMs or the need to upgrade SIM cards.”
Idehen said flouting SIM registration has implications for personal and national security.
