The EFCC, Kwara state command, has arrested a 30-year-old man who defrauded Idris Abubakar, the Emir of Okuta in Kwara state, of N33,399,999.
Wilson Uwujaren, the EFCC spokesman, said the suspect, Fidelis Poor, convinced the traditional ruler that he had a container of goods that will help in the development of the community.
Poor then told the emir, a former member of representatives, that the container needed to be cleared in Abuja, urging the traditional ruler to foot the bill for the clearance.
“The Ilorin Zonal Command of the EFCC has arrested one Fidelis Poor, a member of a syndicate who allegedly connived to defraud a first class traditional ruler in Kwara State, His Royal Highness, Idris Sero Abubakar, to the tune of N33,399,999,” he said.
According to him, the 30-year-old fraudster comes from Stwue in Konshisha Local Government Area of Benue State.
In a petition dated November 30, 2021, the emir alleged that a group of fraudsters who operate as syndicate called him on phone sometime last year that he had a container to clear in Abuja and requested for the said amount for clearance.”
He provided different accounts for the Emir to pay the money into.
