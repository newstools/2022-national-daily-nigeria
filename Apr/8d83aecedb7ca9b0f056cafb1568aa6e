The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commenced comprehensive negotiation and allocation of party tickets for the 2023 general elections in the state. There are indications that the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, who had earlier intended to go to the Senate in 2023, may  step down for the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila for the Lagos West senatorial ticket. The Speaker of the House of Representatives was said to have indicated interest for the governorship ticket of the Lagos APC in 2023 which the party was said to have purportedly conceded to the current governor.
The state party was said to have purportedly given out the governorship ticket to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for a second tenure.
From the current negotiations, it would appear that Senator Solomon Adeola may not be going back to the Senate in 2023.
Rt. Hon. Obasa was gathered to have been given the consent to retain the Speaker of the State Assembly after the 2023 elections.
Lagos Central may also have a  new senatorial candidate.
and of course, the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bpla Tinubu, has the exclusive allocation  of the presidential ticket.
The negotiations have been intensified since last week between the various power blocs in the Lagos APC.
