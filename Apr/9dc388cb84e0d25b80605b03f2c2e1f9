And he’s warning rumour mongers twisting his take on zoning.
In a statement on Saturday in Lagos, Fayose stated clearly: I will be seeking the ticket of the PDP to contest the next presidential election.
He also stated he has never endorsed former Governor Peter Obi for president.
Fayose said the report credited to him that he had endorsed Obi and zoning of the Presidency to the Southeast is false.
“No doubt, I have great respect for Peter Obi as a leader and I respect his aspiration, but at no point did I endorse his presidential ambition or that the presidency be zoned to Southeast,” he said.
“Rather, my take is that the presidency be zoned to the Southern part of Nigeria.”
Adding Fayose to the mix, the PDP now has a bubbly cocktail of presidential wannabes from all the geo-political zones.
Others who declared earlier include ex-V.P Atiku Abubakar, ex-Sen President Bukola Saraki, Sokoto Gov Aminu Tabuwal, Bauchi Gov Bala Mohammed, Obi, publisher Dele Momodu, and Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike.
Fayose is still fighting it out with the EFCC  in court over corruption allegation stamped on him when he was governor.
