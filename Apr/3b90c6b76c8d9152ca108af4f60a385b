Drinking water is very important as it helps hydrate and nourishes the body. You will agree with me that drinking cold or chilled water on a hot and sunny day can be very refreshing and rejuvenating for your body. The calm you will feel is unexplainable right?
However, some persons have cultivated the habit of drinking very cold and chilled water after eating a spicy or hot meal. You are harming your body if you are in this category. According to Healthline, the following are viable reasons why you shouldn’t drink hot water after a meal, especially a hot or spicy one.
1. Indigestion problems; Fatty foods tend to solidify when accompanied by cold water, which makes digestion more difficult and tedious for the digestive system. This can result in digestive problems like constipation and acid reflux (heartburn)
2. Drinking cold water after a meal can make the mucous membrane in your nose thicker hence obstructing your breathing. If your nostril was blocked before eating spicy foods, your body might want to flush the mucous out but drinking cold water will make this impossible.
Some persons are so addicted that they drink cold water even when they have catarrh, this can make the inflammation in your nose and throat worse
3. It can worsen or intensify migraine headaches in people who are suffering from migraines. This category of people should avoid the temptation or urge to drink ice or cold water after eating meals
4. It worsens achalasia pains; achalasia is a rare health disorder which makes the oesophagus unable to move food into the stomach. This can be worsened when one drinks cold water after meals.
For your general well being, you should cultivate the habit of drinking warm water or tea after eating as the Chinese people do.
