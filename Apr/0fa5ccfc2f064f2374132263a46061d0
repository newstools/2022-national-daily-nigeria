Jonathan is eyeing the presidency after eight years after he left, and he’s banking Buhari for an automatic ticket as Jonathan dumps his party PDP for the ruling APC.
A report by the Nation claims sources close to the ex-president said yesterday in Abuja that many of his leading advisers and ex-ministers have told Jnathan to perish the thought.
According to them, the vibes from Aso Rock and the APC leadership don’t call for any hope of an automatic ticket—the condition Jonathan allegedly gave those who dangled the carrot before him.
The advisers said that Jonathan was directed to “go and try his luck” like other aspirants.
The APC national leader Bola Tinubu, V.P Yemi Osinbajo, Minister Rotimi Amaechi, and others have declared their intentions to scramble for the party ticket.
None of these aspirants is willig to give Jonathan a chance as a consensus, according to the advisers.
“Up till Wednesday, he had not got a firm commitment either from Buhari or APC to be the consensus candidate,” the newspaper quoted a source.
“He is also not in a position to win the APC presidential primaries because he has no structure in place barely a month to the primaries.
“In fairness, we felt there was no possibility of wielding the state apparatchik in his favour to earn the APC presidential ticket.”
