Yahaya Bello had appointed Hafusa, one of Abiola’s daughter to be his campaign DG and in an interview recently Hafusat made it known that she accepted to work for Yahaya Bello because he has some qualities of her father.
This statement has sprung up several reaction from social media users and most importantly, Tundun Abiola who is a sister to Hafusa.
