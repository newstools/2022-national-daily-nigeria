These are certainly the best of times for Nollywood Actor and member representing Surulere State Constituency 1 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, Honourable Desmond Elliot.
This medium can report exclusively that the second term Lawmaker and Chairman of the House Committee on Parastatal Monitoring Office (PMO) has been endorsed by leaders and elders of the Surulere Local Government chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to represent the Surulere State Constituency 1 in the state Assembly for the third term.
The leaders of the party in the area led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon Femi Gbajabiamila have all agreed to present Elliot again.



At a shadow election called on Monday, 18 April, 2022, about 10 aspirants jostling for the seat were persuaded to step down for the incumbent Lawmaker. Fuad Laguda, perceived to be the strongest rival to Elliot was eventually persuaded to also step down the following day after initially putting up a resistance the previous day.
To convince the leaders of his desire to pull out on the race, Laguda released a press statement on Tuesday, 19 April, 2022 to back up his decision to pull out of the race.
It was learnt that Elliot is seen as a potential future Speaker of the state Assembly.
“By the time Governor Sanwo-Olu completes his second, Governorship pendulum will swing to another Senatorial District, ultimately the position of the Speaker will also swing to another Senatorial District, so Desmond is seen as a potential Speaker of the Assembly,”.
