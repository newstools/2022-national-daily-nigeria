Manchester United had last week confirmed the signing of Erik ten Hag as their permanent manager to replace the interim boss Ralf Rangnick by the end of the current season.
And the Dutchman who signed a three-year deal with the Red Devils last week appears to have his work cut out at Old Trafford, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic all looked set to leave the club on free transfers when their contracts expire by the end of this season.
It seemed easy for the Dutchman to have identified the weak spots in United squad and he wants to sign a centre-back, a right-back, at least one central midfielder and a striker to bolster the squad.
Meanwhile, National Daily gathered from the report by ESPN that United have given the outgoing Ajax boss a budget of between £100m-£150m, which would not cover the additions he wants to make
It’s therefore claimed that the Dutchman is willing to part with five players in order to top-up his transfer budget, with United’s board willing to release all additional funds from player sales.
United will therefore listen to offers for Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Anthony Martial, Alex Telles and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with Ten Hag open to letting them all leave the club.
United signed Martial for an initial £36m, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s move from Crystal Palace could rise to £50m depending on clauses in his deal.
Those departures would be the two most controversial from the group, but Bailly, Jones and Telles are all keen to play first-team football.
