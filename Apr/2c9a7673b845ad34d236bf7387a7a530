Paul was asked to help fix the diesel generator as he was coming back from an event that evening in Warri, Delta.
After he was done working it, and the engine was in full swing, Paul was about to step out when his flowing garment got snagged by the generator’s flywheel.
The generator picked him up, and smashed him on the concrete floor, his head and mouth battered.
The father of four bled for as long as it took co-tenants to come around, and rushed him to hospital
On reporting to the police, the landlord was arrested.
Paul’s family now demand the landlord must explain how it all happened.
