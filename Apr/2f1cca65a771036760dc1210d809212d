A self-acclaimed disciple of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Simon Ekpa has revealed that the auto crash involving former President Goodluck Jonathan was not an accident but rather a failed assassination attempt.
It would be recalled that the former president was involved in a car accident that led to the loss of lives of two of his aides in the vicinity of the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport in Abuja.
Ekpa, while reacting to the incident in a post on his Twitter account, charged the former president to change his convoy to avoid a repeat of the accident.

He wrote, “Goodluck Jonathan’s involvement in an accident yesterday was an attempted assassination. The plan to assassinate Goodluck Jonathan is ongoing by the terrorist government.
“Can the security agents, the road safety give us details of what they believe led to the accident yesterday?
 “Those planning to kill Goodluck Jonathan will not stop. The last time the gunmen invaded his house. President Jonathan must change the position of his car during the convoy’s movement, and also add 3 more similar cars to his convoys. This is very important to do for the coming months.”
