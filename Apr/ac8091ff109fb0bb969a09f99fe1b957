Abdu Umar, the State Commissioner of Police, stated this on Thursday.
According to him, the woman was sitting close to an uncompleted building when she was dragged into the building and raped by the suspect on March 24.
He said the old woman was screaming for help and was too weak to fight back against her rapist.
Ya’u was caught in the act by one Usman Haruna, a 29- year-old grandson of the victim who alerted the police before the suspect was arrested.
“The grandson caught him on top of the woman with his trousers down and a charm tied around his waist,’’ the police commissioner said.
Umar said Ya’u hs confessed to the crime, and will be charged after investigation.
