The former president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, as reacted to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, as he vowed that he would never return to Twitter, even if his account was reinstated by the new owner.
Reacting further, the Republican leader said that he would be using his own social media site, “Truth Social” to pass whatever information he wants to pass even though it appears that, he has posted just once on the site after it was launched in February.
Donald Trump said, “I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on TRUTH SOCIAL. Elon Musk is a good man who would improve Twitter’s service.”
He said Truth has taken in millions of people and the response they got from these people is that, Truth is better than being on Twitter.
Prior this development, former president Donald Trump was banned for life from when his supporters invaded the US Capitol before the US presidential election he lost.
