Some hours ago, Babajide Kolade Otitoju (BKO) of TVC News reacted to the advice given to Senator Eyinnanya Abaribe by the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu.
Adamu Abdullahi was reported by Television Continental (TVC) to have advised Senator Abaribe to decamp to his party and pick the governorship ticket for his state. This advice made Babajide Kolade Otitoju reveal the politician that might never make Senator Abaribe decamp to the APC. He said, “with Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in the All Progressives Congress, Abaribe will never decamp.” He added, “you all need to understand that it is more like expecting Shekarau to stay in the same political party with Rabiu Kwankwaso; that will never work.”

Lastly, Babajide Kolade Otitoju compared Senator Eyinnanya Abaribe to Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Sule Lamido of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) saying, “none of them can leave their political parties for another.”
Dear esteemed Readers, do you also agree with the well known Nigerian investigative journalist that Senator Abaribe will forever remain in the PDP?
