The Minister of Transportation and presidential aspirant on the platform pf the ruling All Progressives congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, may have won the heart of the traditional ruler of Akure Kingdom, His Royal Majesty, Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi, in southwest Nigeria, when he visited the monarch to seek royal blessings. Amaechi, at the Palace of the Ondo monarch, promised to construct a seaport in Ondo and complete the railway track in the state.
The traditional ruler of Akure Kingdom, His Royal Majesty, Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi, had expressed his belief in the minister, expressing his conviction that Amaechi will fulfil his promises. The royal father maintained that Amaechi is a credible politician.
Oba Aladelusi reiterated the demand for rail line and seaport in Ondo State.
Amaechi had in earlier conversation explained: “When I came, Akure was not part of the Lagos-Calabar railway but I included Akure. The deputy governor told me he wants the seaport. I said fine, if you have investors, we will give you a licence.
“Our job as government is to give licence for the seaport. I made the job, Your Majesty. There are very few candidates you vote as presidents that will continue the railway because it takes a strong and determined mind like President Buhari to continue with the loan for the construction of the railway. So, the chances are that if you vote the wrong person, the whole thing would have been aborted.”
After the explanation and promises, the minister informed the royal father that he came to Ondo State to seek the support of the party members to win the APC ticket at the party’s national convention, including the presidential election, thereafter.
He assured the royal father that he has the requisite qualities to be the President of Nigeria, citing his political antecedents and successes as state legislator, governor and now minister.
