One Benedict Anieze, living in the pipeline area of Idimu, Lagos has confessed to killing his one-month old baby by smashing her head on the ground, leading to the baby’s death.
Anieze, who has been arrested by the police said he was at home with his wife and baby when he suddenly became erratic, picked their child and smashed her on the ground which led to her death.
After carrying out the dire act, Benedict allegedly set his house on fire before fleeing the scene.
The spokesperson of the Lagos state police command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who confirmed the incident to newsmen said the police alongside the neighbors tracked down the suspect to a location in the area, where he was arrested.
He told the police during the preliminary investigation that he hit the baby on the ground because of evil spirits.
The spokesperson said: “There was no argument between him and his wife. He said he was possessed by evil spirits when he smashed the baby on the ground. He also set the house ablaze and ran away.
The wife cried out and after putting out the fire, they brought her to the station. The police alongside neighbours tracked him down to the place where he was arrested.
The corpse has been deposited at the Yaba General Hospital’s morgue.”
Hundeyin added that the case has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department for further investigation.
