The former special assistant to former president Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has taken out his time to drag a presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba for making use of twitter after supporting President Buhari’s twitter ban some months back.
According to a tweet he made on his verified twitter handle, Reno Omokri made it known that Adamu Garba who said that he will set up an alternative to Twitter, so as to support Buhari’s twitter ban, is presently back on twitter begging for money to buy his nomination form.
It should be recalled that Adamu Garba fully supported President Muhammadu Buhari, when he reportedly banned twitter last year, but as it stands now, he has been on twitter asking Nigerians to donate money for him, so that he will be able to buy the ₦100 million APC presidential nomination form.
Based on what Reno Omokri has just said here, but I don’t see any reason why Adamu Garba should stop using twitter just because he supported Buhari’s twitter ban. But be it as it may, we all are entitled to our individual opinions.
