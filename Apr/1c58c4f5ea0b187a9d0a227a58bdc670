The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, had raised the price of the presidential expression of interest and nomination forms to a whooping N100 million.
This development has been generating controversy as many Nigerians have condemned the decision by the ruling party. To some people, this decision is a strategy to shut some competent aspirants out of the race and pave way for some deep-pocket politicians in government who can easily afford the said amount.

Although, the hike in price of the forms ran contrary to the plan of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, yet, he went on to make some revelations in defense of the party’s decision. Ngige disclose that some Reps members, Senators, Governors and even Presidents fail to fund the party after they have used its platform to win elections. This problem makes it hard for the party to have money to fund its activities.
In this regard, Ngige made a vital point in defense of the APC for hiking the price of the forms. Accordingly, he argued that the party might have raised the money this way to realize enough funds to run its affairs since the aspirants and those that eventually win usually shy away from funding the party afterwards. Ngige even said that he had that experience during his days in the Peoples Democratic Party, the defunct Action Congress of Nigerian and finally now that he is in the ruling APC.
Could it be that Ngige is telling the truth as an insider? He even said that he has been friends with Adamu during their days in the PDP and in the Senate. Whichever way it is, the fact is that Ngige backs APC’s decision to raise the price.
