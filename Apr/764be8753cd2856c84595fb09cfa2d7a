Mr. Kayode Fayemi is among those who might be in the race for the ticket of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress. He has not actually formally declared bid to become the president of the country. There is a reason for this.
There is no doubt that Fayemi eyes the seat now occupied by the president, Muhammadu Buhari. But he is still consulting. And that is why he has not openly made any declaration for the race.
The struggle for the ticket of the party is surreal. It has attracted several big names including the APC national leader, Mr. Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the incumbent vice president of the federation, Yemi Osinbajo.
Mr. Fayemi wants to see his chances. He wants to know his odds before he joins the train for the competition. And that is why he is still hesitant.
The governor, whose tenure in Ekiti State ends this year, was at Ondo State today. Both Fayemi and Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu are colleagues, and their two states share boundaries.
According to report, the Ekiti State governor emphasized that the outcome of the consultation would determine if he will contest. He will most certainly use the platform of the party if he deems it fit to contest for the race.
Mr. Fayemi didn’t reveal details of his consultation with the Ondo State governor. But he made it clear that he was in Akure because of the consultation process, and to seek the advice of Rotimi Akeredolu.
