There is emerging tension of nuclear war in Europe as former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday cautioned NATO against admitting Finland or Sweden into the organization. Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council, and President 2008 to 2012 threatened that Russia would deploy nuclear weapons close to the Baltic States and Scandinavia if Finland or Sweden joins NATO.
Medvedev, on Telegram wrote: “if the countries joined, this would more than double Russia’s land border with NATO members.
“Naturally, we will have to reinforce these borders.
“In this case, it would not be possible to talk any more about the Baltic non-nuclear status. The balance has to be restored.”
The former President maintained that Russia would be entitled to deploy nuclear weapons in the region. According to him,  Russia would “seriously reinforce its group of ground forces and air defences and deploy significant naval forces in the Gulf of Finland.”
Dmitry Peskov, Russian spokesman, also stated: “this has been talked about many times” and President Vladimir Putin has issued an order on “reinforcing our western flank” due to NATO’s growing military potential.
Finland and Sweden had maintained military non-alignment policies in the territory.
