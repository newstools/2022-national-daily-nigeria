The father of one took to his InstaStory to decry the problem saying “The fake products in this country are more than the original.
“And the painful part is that some of these vendors will sell the fake for the price of the original. Even if you must sell fake, why can’t you have the fake and the original, so anyone that can’t afford the original will then have the option of buying the fake?
“Somethings (sic), our problem is not the government, our problem is us.”
