A batch of the campaign groups of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the South-West Agenda for Asiwaju (SWAGA) , on Friday rejected any form of arrangement in the party for the emergence of a consensus presidential  candidate in the preparations for the 2023 general  election. The group vowed that the members will not agree to a consensus arrangement for the selection of the APC presidential candidate.
Chairman of SWAGA, Sen. Dayo Adeyeye, after purchasing the APC presidential form for Tinubu at N100 million in Abuja, declared that all presidential aspirants must be allowed to test their popularity at the party’s primaries. SWAGA, sponsored by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu Lagos State, asserted that Tinubu “understands the diverse nature of the Nigerian economy.”
Beside Tinubu, other aspirants for the APC presidential ticket include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, Rochas Okorocha, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, among others.
