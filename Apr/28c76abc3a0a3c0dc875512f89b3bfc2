Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams has made clarifications about the burial on Saturday.
A statement by spokesman Kehinde Aderemi noted that the transition and burial rites of the monarch were “purely traditional and not religious”.
According to him, the first round of ritual was carried out by the Isoro and the Oyomesi before the death of the monarch was announced by the state government.
“The Muslim community led by the Chief Imam of Oyo, Sheikh Masud Adabayo Ajokideru did the prayer on the remains for seven minutes.
“They handed over the remains to the Isoro for further observation of final traditional rites that led to the final burial at Ibara. This is the truth.
“Alaafin is not an ordinary king. The Oyomesi, the Isoro and the Sango devotees cannot but complete the final traditional rites.”
Adams said that the impression that Oba Adeyemi was buried according to Muslim rites “is untrue and at variance with the tradition of Oyo and Yoruba institution”.
He however added the late oba respected all religions.
