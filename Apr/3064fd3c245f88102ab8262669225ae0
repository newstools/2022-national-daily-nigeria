Popular Nigerian journalist and former presidential candidate, Dele Momodu, has reacted to the appearance of leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu in court today, saying he would continue to encourage the Federal Government to toll the path of peace with all aggrieved Nigerians by availing them opportunities for dialogue to bridge their differences. He said nothing is too much to achieve with peace.Momodu’s reaction comes after Federal High Court sitting on the trial of Kanu reduced the charge against the secessionist leader from 15 to 7.
According to a report in Vanguard Newspaper, Justice Binta Nyako said eight of the 15-count treasonable felony charge against Kanu were repetitions that could not be substantiated with evidence by the plaintiff, the Federal Government of Nigeria.
The Judge therefore struck out eight of the 15-count charge against the defendant by the prosecutor.
Counts that were struck out in court today include 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the charge while Kanu would now be tried on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15.
This ruling comes after Kanu through his lawyer had filed an application to the court to strike out an entire charge against him, insisting that the charges at incompetent and legally defective.
The leader of the proscribed secessionist group has since 2021 been facing trials after he was allegedly extraordinarily renditioned from Kenya under controversial circumstances.
