Nuru got the axe on Monday after his last Friday sermon urging Nigerians to demand security before voting in the 2023 elections.
Before the sack, committee chairman Senator Saidu Dansadau said he warned the Imam to avoid preaching that could trigger unrest in the country.
The cleric then climaxed it with he last Friday sermon.
“I had personally sat down with Sheik Nuru Khalid. I told him that Nigeria is currently in a delicate situation regarding the election, so we need to be careful.Since you came to the mosque, you have been attacking the government and nothing has changed. Focus on telling Nigerians to return to God,” the lawmaker told the BBC Hausa service.
“Our biggest issue with Sheik Nuru Khalid was that he said Nigerians should not vote except politicians assure them of security. We felt that some Nigerians will take advantage of the statement due to what is currently happening in Nigeria. Some people don’t want the 2023 elections to be held,” the lawmaker said.
Dansandau wondered why people said he just want the government to give him a position and that was why we sacked the Imam,
“Others are saying that I was paid to do so.  But the God that I serve knows my mind.”
