The actress in a post on Instagram said she had only raised issues about her marriage on social media because of the false narrative being told about her.
She, therefore, urged the public to forgive her estranged husband, as he is human and not perfect.
Yewande wrote, “Please kindly stop dragging Daddy Precious online. If not that I had to debunk a false narrative being told against me regarding our issue, the truth about our present situation would still have been kept private, like I wanted it.
“I know he has made a lot of mistakes. Please kindly forgive him. He is human and far from perfect.”
