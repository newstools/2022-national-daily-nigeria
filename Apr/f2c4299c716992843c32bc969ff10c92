Ace investigative journalist, Babajide Kolade-otitoju, has reacted to the killing of more than 100 Nigerians during a recent attack by gunmen. In a recent interview on TVC News, Babajide described the development as an “animalistic killing” of people.
Reacting to the news, Babajide said, “The attack on Kanam and Wase LGAs, Plateau State, can be described as one of the most “animalistic killings” of people in recent times. The reporter mentioned that at least 175 people were killed after the last count. That is the worst in recent times. Some corpses were recovered from the forests and bushes. This is unacceptable. We would have made noise if such an incident happened in European countries. However, it is no longer news in our country. Nobody has resigned over the incompetence of protecting the people. The killers are destroying the lives of farmers.
He continued, “When you destroy people’s means of livelihood in this manner, it leads to hatred and a never-ending fight. The affected people had to resort to mass burial. It has nothing to do with religion. The affected LGAs are dominated by Muslims. The bandits do not belong to any religion, as many of them are idol worshipers.”
