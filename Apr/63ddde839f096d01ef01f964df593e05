According to a documentary by BBC, There are some secrets only known by the cabin crew and will never let passengers know to avoid panic.
Here are some of them:
If a person dies on a flight they just remain in their seats.
If a person by any chance loses his or her life in the plane, the body is strapped into the seat until the final destination, but in case there is a space, the body can be placed in it.
Emergency oxygen masks can only last for 15 minutes.

During this period, the pilots will try to bring the plane to a lower altitude where oxygen concentration is a bit higher. That is the reason the oxygen in the plane mask is set for between 12 to 15 minutes.
The chimes that keep sounding mid-flight are secret codes.
Chimes may be used to alert the flight attendants of something for example in case of an emergency. It can also be a signal of change from one thing to another.
