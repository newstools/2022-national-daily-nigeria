Sharing a screengrab of Falegan’s post on its verified Instagram page, UNICEF Nigeria said, “SCAM ALERT  UNICEF Nigeria is aware of a fictitious donation drive to raise funds for UNICEF. Please be aware that all legitimate campaigns for donations are hosted on the UNICEF website www.unicef.org and verified social media pages. Do not fall victim to this scam!”
Meanwhile, Falegan shared a video of donation being on UNICEF IG page with the caption, “We were able to raise 61 pounds for the people of Ukraine through @unicef, this is for the people of Ukraine who passed through a lot of dysfunctional/ disheartening situations in recent times.”
Falegan urged his followers to donate to his foundation also.
