Ahead of the 2023 Presidential Election, It’s no longer a news that the Incumbent Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi has declared his intention to contest for President under the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform. The Immediate past Governor of Rivers State is expected to slug it out with the APC National Leader and Ex-Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the APC Presidential Ticket.

Although, Tinubu control a strong political structure in the South-West Geo-political Zone where he hails from, Amaechi might have an edge over him in the Northern Region.
It’s no longer a news that Amaechi played a major role to ensure the electoral victory of Presidential Muhammadu Buhari during the 2015 and 2019 General Elections. To show appreciation for his support, Amaechi was conferred with a Chieftaincy Title in Daura, President Buhari’s Hometown in Katsina State.
Equally, The North has benefitted massively from Amaechi’s current position as the Minister of Transportation, his Administration has facilitated the construction of several rail projects across the North. To replicate his Achievements and Loyalty to Buhari, they might back his 2023 Presidential Ambition.
