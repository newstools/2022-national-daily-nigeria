Reno Omokri who is a popular Nigerian Public Commentator and Human Rights Activist has listed four sets of people he claimed may not be able to afford the All Progressives Congress (APC) N100M Presidential Form.
Reno who took to his social media page to list them based his claim on their annual income as he gave a summary of the amount people who fall into the categories he mentioned received annually.
According to him, anyone whose income is based on Nigeria’s minimum wage will only earn ₦360k in a year. Just as he said that Nigeria’s average income is ₦500k yearly. He also said that Buhari’s ministers’ average wage is ₦8 million yearly and that Osunbade’s average wage is ₦12 million yearly”.
With this breakdown, Reno has captured virtually all categories of working class people in Nigeria and to him, none of them can afford the form based on the analysis he made. He concluded his post by saying, “It is impossible for these 4 categories to honestly afford a ₦100 million form!”
