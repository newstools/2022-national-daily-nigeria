Reality TV star and ex Big Brother Naija season 6 housemate, Angel JB Smith, has revealed that one of her first terms and conditions to anyone who wants to be her partner is that she does not want to have a baby.
Recall that the reality TV star initially sparked mixed reactions from the public when she made a similar statement in the past; according to her, she does not want kids.
However, it seems the reality TV star does not intend to change her decision, as she recently stated that she will tell anyone that wants to be her partner that she doesn’t want a baby, and she may not change her mind. Angel also revealed that her decision does not sit well with people, as she stated that it’s always funny watching them back out afterwards. The reality TV star wrote:
“The first thing I tell anyone that wants to be my partner is that I don’t want a baby and my mind might not change and watching them run away is always so funny”
