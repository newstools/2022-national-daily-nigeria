Whiteheads are clogged hair follicles that have become larger due to the accumulation of skin oils, cells, and germs. “According to Healthline and Mayo Clinic” there are 4 natural remedies for removing whiteheads on the nose.

Whiteheads occur when the skin pores become clogged. Whiteheads are easy to treat, and you don’t need to spend a lot of money on pricey lotions to get rid of them.
Here are four natural remedies for removing whiteheads from the nose.
1. A dash of lemon juice
Citric acid, found in lemons, aids in drying up excess oil on the skin, which is what causes whiteheads in the first place. If you have sensitive skin, only use raw lemon juice or dilute it with water. Apply the juice to your nose with a cotton ball and wash it off after 10-15 minutes.
2. Aloe Vera gel
Aloe Vera is also one of the most effective natural treatments for whiteheads. To provide extra moisture to your skin, apply aloe vera gel directly from the leaf to your nose. It will open up your pores and make your skin feel a lot smoother.
3. Tomatoes
Tomatoes are excellent for your skin and are used to treat a variety of ailments. By mashing the tomato and adding lemon juice to it, you can make a paste. Wait around half an hour after applying this paste to your nose. To shut the pores, wash them off with warm water and then with cold water.
4. Steam produced by hot water
Steaming your face stimulates clogged pores to open up. Whiteheads can be treated by boiling water, pouring it into a bowl, and holding the affected portion of the body over the basin. They can form a steam tent over their heads to concentrate the steam on their upper bodies in the case of the head and neck area.
