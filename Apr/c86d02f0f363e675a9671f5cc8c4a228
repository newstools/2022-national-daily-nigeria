Power distribution Companies (DisCos) rejected a total of 2,495.3 megawatts of electricity in one week amid the outcry of blackouts in various locations across the country by consumers.
The latest industry figures on the Discos load summary obtained from the Transmission Company of Nigeria showed that the power distributors did not utilize a huge amount of electricity in the first week of April.
An analysis of the report indicated that most power firms failed to utilise the electricity allocated to them by TCN under the Multi-Year Tariff Order allocation from April 2 to April 8, 2022.
One megawatt is equal to one million watts. If one home needs 1 kWh of energy for one hour, then 2,495.3MW of energy can sustain over 20 million homes, over 22.2% of the 90 million persons without electricity in the country.
Nigeria’s 11 Discos include Abuja, Benin, Eko, Enugu, Ibadan, Ikeja, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt and Yola, and there have been a series of complaints about the poor delivery of electricity by these firms.
