The Nigerian former minister of aviation on the platform of the people’s democratic party and a current member of the all progressives congress, Femi Fani-Kayode made series of tweets recently where he said he would no longer keep quiet because of politics and watch impunity continue in the country.
The former minister who was one of the most active critics of this present administration until he joined the ruling party was reacting to the latest killings in Benue and plateau states. In his reaction, the former chieftain of the people’s democratic party submitted that Buhari’s administration has a few months to put an end to what he described as “madness”. The former minister urged the government to find ways to put an end to the genocide.
Femi Fani-Kayode has asked in his recent submission how many Nigerians will have to die before citizens will cultivate a sense of national outrage. He believes that politics should be put aside so that truth could prevail.
The former chieftain of the people’s democratic party urged the federal government to take actions without further delay in order to fish out those responsible for such evil act.
Since his statement, different reactions and comments have greeted his submission, leaving many Nigerians to wonder if he is working for the people’s democratic party in the all progressives congress.
Femi Fani-Kayode was a strong member and chieftain of the people’s democratic party until recently when he moved over to the all progressives congress. His recent statement against the administration of the all progressives congress makes Nigerians wonder if all is well with him in the camp of the all progressives congress or he is working for the people’s democratic party?
