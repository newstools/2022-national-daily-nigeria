Have you ever wondered why planes dump fuel before landing? Rather than being wasteful, it is a very effective method to use while in midair and about to land because it reduces the plane’s weight, causing it to land with less stress. Typically, planes do not dump fuel in mid-flight or during takeoff or landing; instead, they do so just before landing.
The stress of landing a plane is greater than that of taking off. Heavy fuel adds to the stress, so if the pilot deems it necessary to reduce the airplane’s weight before landing, he may choose to dump some of it.

The quickest way to get rid of fuel is to dump it just before landing. When a sufficient amount of fuel is utilized during a flight or an emergency occurs, the fuel is dumped, resulting in a lighter plane with less stress on the plane.
Another clear reason to discard fuel right before landing is that it will make the plane’s landing smoother, easier, and much safer. Dumping fuel in midair or during takeoff doesn’t offer the same benefits as dumping it right before landing.

In aviation, fast and emergency landings are the most common reasons for airplanes to dump fuel these days, but as you can see, this does not occur on every flight or with every airplane. It’s only used when immediate action is required, but it’s still a viable option in many situations.
