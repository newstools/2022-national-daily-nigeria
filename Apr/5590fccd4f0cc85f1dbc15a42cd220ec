“Demands for internet services have increased the need for more capacity, and sustainable collaborations with all relevant stakeholders within the public and private sectors. Google’s commitment of $1billion across five years in various interventions will support digital transformation in Nigeria and across Africa”, said Ehimuan.
She stated that research has proven that Africa would have an additional 300 million Internet users and Nigeria would lead in that number, given its current statistics of over 141 million internet subscribers and broadband penetration of over 40.88 percent as at January 2022.
The Equiano cable system is the third private international cable owned by Google and the 14th subsea cable invested by Google.
It connects Portugal and South Africa, running along the West Coast of Africa, with branching units along the way that can be used to extend connectivity to more African countries.
The first branch is expected to land in Nigeria by the end of April 2022.
