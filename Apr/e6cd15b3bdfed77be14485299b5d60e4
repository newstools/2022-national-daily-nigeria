Controversial OAP and Free The Sheeple Leader, Daddy Freeze has lambasted his followers who insist that the husband is the head of the family so his wife must be submissive to him.

Freeze told the woman: “Must you marry an African?”
He added: “Why should ‘remain single’ be the only option?”

Freeze slammed the follower writing: “Nigeria has trapped hour body bro, don’t let it trap your brain…
