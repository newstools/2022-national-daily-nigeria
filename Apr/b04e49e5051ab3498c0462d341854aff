A United States court has rescheduled the trial of Abba Kyari, a suspended top Nigerian police officer, and five others, over their alleged complicity in alleged $1.1 million fraud coordinated by Ramon Abbas, aka Hushpuppi.
The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California rescheduled the trial from May to October 2022 based on a joint request by the prosecution and three of Mr Kyari’s co-defendants.
This comes amid uncertainties plaguing the extradition proceedings filed against Mr Kyari at the Federal High Court in Abuja, where he is also undergoing trial on cocaine-trafficking charges.
