Kaduna government has told visiting APC’s national leader Bola Tinubu the state is aware he wants to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, and it looks forward to further engagement with the party leader.
Gov. Nasir el-Rufai said Nigeria is at a crossroads now, and difficult decisions have to be made to get the nation out of the quagmire.
“These are human challenges and they can be solved by human ingenuity. I pray for God to choose who is best for Nigeria, so that we will be the better, united, progressive and exemplary country that is fair and just to everyone,” he told Tinubu on Tuesday.
“We are aware of your aspiration to be president of this country, we look forward to further engagement so that we can progress that aspiration.”
The APC governor thanked Tinubu for the visit.
“We are very grateful to you for service, sacrifice and commitment to the unity and that of our country.”
Tinubu started his barnstorm as early as last year, moving round the country for what he called consultation before and after he declared his intention to become president.
