Kunle Adeyanju, the brave Nigerian traveling from London to Lagos State, Nigeria, has made remarkable progress on his journey as he approaches the shores of Africa. The news came as a surprise to all doubters who thought the journey was impossible.
The journey, which he started last Tuesday, is expected to last for 25 days. Within the first six days, he has been able to make it to the shores of Africa. He said the reason he embarked on the charity journey was to generate some funds so he could use them to create a good source of water and other welfare packages for the people of Africa.
