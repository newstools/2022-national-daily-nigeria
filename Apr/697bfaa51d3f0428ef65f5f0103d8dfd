Some stakeholders in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have engaged in latent protest of perceived imbalance in the allocation of national delegates to the various geo-political zones and states in the country. The delegate’s allocation is perceived to be to the advantage of the north, apparently, to the detriment of the south.
Of the 7,800 national delegates, the three zones in the north have 4,414 delegates, and the south 3,333 delegates.
The concerned APC stakeholders express the fear that the imbalance of national delegates allocation will influence the party’s national convention for the election of the presidential candidate. They, therefore, demanded for review of the national delegates slots to the various states and regions, seeking equal representation of north and south. the northwest has the highest figure, followed by the southwest, then the north central, northeast, south-south and southeast.
The zonal distribution of national delegates of the ruling APC are as follows:
Northwest:     1, 924 delegates
Southwest:     1,568 delegates
North Central:  1,278 delegates
Northeast:       1, 212 delegates
South-south      927 delegates
Southeast:       838 delegates
This amount to a total of 7,800 national delegates.
The distribution of the national delegates across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are as follows:
Kano State 465 delegates
