He made the appeal during a condolence visit to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) office in Giwa on Monday.
However, he called for special training of volunteers and vigilante members, and other rigorous government approach in eliminating the insecurity in communities.
Abdulrauf, who commensurated with the victims of attacks in the area said incessant bandits rampage on communities in the constituency had resulted into huge loss of lives and valuables.
He condemned the incidents and urged government at all levels to do more to safeguard the lives and property of citizens.
Abdulrauf identified corruption, poverty and unemployment as major causes of crimes in the society, urging communities to rise against criminals.
The aspirant however assured the residents that the situation would soon become a thing of the past when PDP assumed power in 2023.
Responding, the PDP Chairman, Giwa Local Government Area, Alhaji Abdulkadir Kago, commended the concern of the aspirant, describing him as highly humane.
Kago, therefore, appealed for deployment of more military and security personnel in volatile areas of Giwa and Birnin-Gwari to halt the rampaging bandits from terrorising the area.
