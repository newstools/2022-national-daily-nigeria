An aeroplane is the most preferred means of transportation when it comes to traveling by air. It was invented on December 17, 1903, by the Wright brothers and it’s an important part of how the world functions, with people, holidaying and taking business trips, and goods being transported from country to country through its help. But have you ever thought about the fuel that aeroplanes rely on?

For decades, airplanes originally used gasoline. The need for higher-octane fuel, however, prompted aviation experts to experiment with alternative types of fuel, thus paving the way for kerosene. Today, aviation kerosene, also known as QAV-1 is now the most common type of fuel used in airplanes.
We’ll be looking at the top 3 reasons why kerosene is the most preferred fuel source in an aeroplane.
1. Lower costConsidering that large commercial airplanes like the 747 burn roughly 1 gallon of fuel per minute, it’s important for airlines to consider the cost of fuel which could be an expensive operation. Kerosene is much cheaper than gasoline, making it a more affordable option for airlines.
2. Lower Freezing PointKerosene has a lowering freezing point than most fuels, making it naturally protected against freezing in otherwise bone-chilling temperatures. It’s known to have a low freezing point of -47 which is perfect for use as aviation fuel. Aeroplanes can fly at high altitudes while other fuels like petrol can solidify or block the engines, which could cause an accident and result in loss of life.
3. Highly FlammableKerosene is highly flammable, more so than diesel, which gives it the explosive burning qualities required for take-off. In fact, due to the lack of flammability and energy of most fuels, kerosene is considered the number one option because of its initial power and ability to get the plane off the ground.
