“We believe there are two critical elements of nation building; politics is one, and policy is the other. The latter is as indispensable as the former. In order for us to walk the talk of every policy, we should at least first understand what that talk is in its entirety. This is the strategic role PIAFo is designed for,” Azeez said.
