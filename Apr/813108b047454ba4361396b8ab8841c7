Since the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo declared his interest in the fast approaching 2023 presidential election, many social commentators have aired their views about it. Recently, an ace investigative journalist named Babajide Kolade Otitoju (BKO) also aired his opinions concerning Professor Yemi Osinbajo’s presidential ambition.
Babajide Kolade Otitoju said, “I will tell vice president (VP) Yemi Osinbajo not to contest for presidency in 2023 if I have my way.” When Ibraheem Shitta, the TVC News anchor of “Issues With Jide” asked why Babajide Kolade Otitoju made the statement, he responded saying, “is the vice president not part of those who led Nigeria to the present economic situation?”
To Babajide Kolade Otitoju, the vice president ought not to declare at all because his terms in office did not make the country’s economy grow. He said if at all he will contest, he should agree that there are some things the country, under the watch of his principal (Buhari) and him, got worse from how they met it when they came into power.
