The House of Representatives at plenary on Wednesday expressed subtle loss of confidence on the Nigerian Army, lamenting the increasing incessant killings by bandits, Boko Haram, ISWAP, and others across the country. The lawmakers, therefore, urged   President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency in the security sector and recruit mercenaries to strengthen the Nigerian military in fighting the bandits and other terrorists.
The lawmaker, representing Pakshin/Kanke/Kanam Federal Constituency,  Plateau State, Yusuf Gagdi, and his colleague from Gboko/Tarka Federal Constituency, Benue State, John Dyegh, had moved separate motions of urgent national importance to draw the attention of the House to the plight of the villagers in their respective constituencies.
The lawmakers bemoaned those cases of killings have now turned a daily occurrence and had cheapened the lives of Nigerians. They argued that it “would appear that security agencies and the government had lost total control of the situation.”
Some members chided President Buhari who they said the bulk stops on his table. They told the president to take more decisive actions against criminal elements in the country. They also demanded the President to fire the National Security Adviser.
