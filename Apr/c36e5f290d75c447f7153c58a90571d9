Popular businessman and socialite, Obinna Iyiegbu aka Obi Cubana has doled out N40 million to 20 of his former classmates during their secondary school reunion on Friday.
He hosted his 1992 colleagues from Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha in Abuja and the reunion was organised ahead of their forthcoming 30th anniversary.
While addressing his friends at the event, he said the sum would be given to 20 struggling classmates.
“There are some of us here that are struggling. Life is not just about taking pictures and posting on Instagram. I mean, many people think that we have made it in life. People are going through hell and to the glory of God, some of us, God has actually blessed us.
“So, I want to propose something tonight. I want us to do something significant tonight. I want us to set up a fund that will cater, that will take care of some of our classmates who are not well to do. I will support this noble cause by picking up 20 people. When you identify these 20 people, 20 people from the poorest and the poor amongst us, I want to give them N2m.
“Don’t be intimidated by anything. We are not giving because we have, but we are giving because God has enabled us to do so.”
The club baron is known for his large-heartedness which came to the open after his mother’s funeral that saw hundreds of his benefactors attending the event that turned out the biggest that year.
He has since come under the EFCC probe and invitation for interview on drug pushing and money laundering.
