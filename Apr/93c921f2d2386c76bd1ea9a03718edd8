Odogwu as he is fondly called gave the hint when he appeared on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah on Tuesday night.
When asked about when the album would be released, Burna Boy provided an unclear answer to his host.
He said, “It’s going to come out on a day everyone celebrates for themselves, when it’s their own day.”
To which, Trevor responded, “Okay, I don’t know what that means but I feel it. You have just left me with a riddle to figure out. I’m like, is it a Friday, is it a birthday, is it a Sunday?…depends on the day you celebrate what you do.”
Interjecting, Burna Boy said, “It’s not what you do. It’s not everybody in the world that has a job you know. But this, everybody has it. Everybody has a day to celebrate.”
Meanwhile, Burna Boy has become the first African artiste to sell out the Madison Square Garden in New York for his headline concert scheduled for Thursday.
