While the internet and Nigeria as a whole have been going crazy over the news of Yul Edochie welcoming a child with another woman, the controversial actor seems to be having g the time of his life.
The actor shared a post n his IG page suggesting that Nigerians have never paid this much attention to him.
The actor goes on to list the number of ways in which he has been prominent in societal matters, as well as the movie industry, but still never got accolades or recognition.
He, however, threw shade at Nigerians for coming at him over the news of his 2nd wife and son.
In his words, So i fit break internet like this? So i can get over 60k comments on one post? But I dey act film, dey give una Hollywood performaces since una no send me.
Best voices, una no send me. I ran for Governor, una no send me. I’ve been a strong voice for the people, been an activist, I do endsars, una no still send me.
But na dis one scatter Internet. Na dis one come make una send me finally. Na waa for una oo.
