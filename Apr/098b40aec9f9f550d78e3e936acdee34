Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State in Zaki Biam, Ukum Local Government Area, after fresh attacks on Benue communities, renewed his call on citizens resident in Benue people to mobilize for self-defence and protect themselves from forces desperate to take over their land.
Governor Ortom frowned at the Fulani herdsmen who embarked in coordinated attacks in some local governments recently, reiterating that the people have to defend themselves. The governor noted that the constitution recognizes self-defence.
“Self defence is recognised by the Constitution and its legal,” Ortom said.
Governor Ortom stated that Community Volunteer Guards was formed by the Benue State government to assist the conventional security operatives to secure the people and the land.
