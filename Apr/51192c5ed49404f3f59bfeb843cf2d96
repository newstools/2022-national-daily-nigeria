Preye Ayase and Ringo Tareladei were caught stealing electric cables connecting Ogobiri and Agorogbene communities in Sagbama on Wednesday, April 20.
Ouseibai Seperegha Godsgift M, the President of the Creek Youths Agenda (CYA) condemned the destruction, stealing and vandalism of power infrastructure in the area.
In a statement made available to newsmen by his Chief Press Secretary Mr Ebis Okpeke, Godsgift expressed his disappointment over the unfortunate incident.
“It is very sad and unfortunate that young people were caught vandalizing our near none electric infrastructures with the aim of making money. It is more worrisome especially now that we are agitating for more development of the creek considering its neglect developmentally over the years.
“To me, I feel pained that young people who ought to protect our facilities in the creek are the ones perpetrating such nefarious acts of destruction,” the statement read.
“Therefore, I urge those with such criminal minds to desist from such and engage themselves in productive ventures that will add value to our creek and the society at large or they should be ready to face the full wrath of the law when apprehended.
The CYA President called on the Bayelsa State Government to come to the aide of the affected communities in restoring power supply by installing already damaged electric facilities in Agorogbene, Ogobiri and other communities.
