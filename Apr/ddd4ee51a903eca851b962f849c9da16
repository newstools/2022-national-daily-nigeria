Incompetent leadership killing Nigeria, says Peter Obifeyor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has disclosed that incompetent leadership is the reason for the appalling state of affairs in the country.
Obi made this assertion on Thursday in his lecture titled, ‘National development: Role of the Nigeria youths’, during the formal inauguration of the National Executive Council of Nigeria Ethnic Nationalities Youth Leaders Council which was held in Abuja.
According to him, the entrenchment of money politics has stunted the growth of the country.
“Nigerians resist the temptation by enemies of collective progress, as well as the influence of moneybags as Nigeria prepares for the 2023 general election.
“Don’t think you are going to get anything out of incompetent leadership no matter how it benefits you personally. It will worsen the entire country and eventually worsen you.
“Let Nigeria’s next leadership from the local governments to the state and federal levels be people who have the capacity to govern; people who have integrity and managers of resources; people who know where to invest. The biggest assets of a country are the human beings that live in that country. Nigeria as a nation has not invested in its people.
