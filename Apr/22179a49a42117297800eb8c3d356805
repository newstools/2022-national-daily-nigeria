Presently, some Muslims from several parts of the world are at Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah which is popularly known as lesser pilgrimage. A well known Nigerian politician who joined these Muslims is Femi Gbajabiamila, the speaker of the House of Representatives.
In the mid hours of today, Honorable Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, took to his verified social media platform (facebook) to share a video showing the moment he was ‘running’ alongside other Muslims inside the mosque in Mecca. When people came across this video, they began reacting.
A certain man named Yusuf Jamiu reacted saying, “it is nice seeing you here Mr speaker and may Allah accept your prayers. Please pray for Asiwaju Tinubu to be successful in 2023 election if God wills.”
Another follower named Maryam Idris reacted saying, “may God accept it as an act of worship. Please pray for our leader to overcome all his known and unknown adversaries.”
