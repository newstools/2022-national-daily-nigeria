Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba, has urged Nigerians to show love to one another as Jesus Christ showed to the world through His death on the Cross at Calvary.
Agba, in his Easter message to Christian faithful and Nigerians of other religions, said love did not recognise ethnicity and religion, hence the love of Christ was universal.
He said that for Nigeria to enjoy rapid development, Nigerians must work with one another on a national agenda for development in love and with common focus on issues that emphasise national unity.
According to him, “the time has come for all of us to dedicate ourselves to the ideals of nation building through collective efforts that constrict the space for ethnicity, religion and other divisive factors.”
He urged all hands to be on deck as the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has just begun the “implementation of the National Development Plan 2021-2025 that will reform and industrialise Nigeria as well as lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.”
