Bandits tormenting Kaduna State may have shut down Mosques in certain parts of the state on Wednesday morning. Many worshipers were said to have remained indoors and did not go to the mosques for morning prayer on Wednesday being frightened of attack by bandits.
The fear was, however, precipitated by the invasion of Rigachikun and Barakallahu communities in the Kaduna-Zaria Road by bandits on Tuesday night, who were shooting sporadically.
The communities were said to be located between the Jaji Military Cantonment and Nigerian Air Force Base in Kaduna.
Apparently, some Mosques were without worshipers on Wednesday for the morning Ramadan prayers as people were afraid of bandits.
