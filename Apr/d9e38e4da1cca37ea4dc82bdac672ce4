A governorship aspirant in the 2023 general election in Plateau State, Prof. Dakas Dakas (SAN), has expressed confidence in the leadership of the newly inaugurated All Progressive Congress (APC), National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu.
Dakas said the age and experience of the brand new National Chairman will certainly count in leading the party to a victory in the 2023 general election.
The guber aspirant stated this during a courtesy visit paid to Adamu in Abuja at the weekend.
He said: “Senator Adamu-led team comprises men and women who have served the nation meritoriously in the private as well as public sectors, in consequence, I have confidence in their ability to pilot the affairs of the party to enviable heights.
“Having had the privilege of serving as a member of the party’s Constitution Amendment Committee, I am confident that the party has been repositioned to raise the bar of party administration and governance in the overall interest of its teeming members and the generality of Nigerians”, Dakas said.
