Blessing, while answering questions on Instagram on Thursday had said that she is no longer married to her husband, Soji.
However, in a post on her Instagram Stories on Friday, she made a U-turn and said she was just responding sarcastically to people who were making insensitive inquiries about her marriage.
Blessing wrote, “After a series of incessant, and borderline insensitive inquiries about my marriage, I responded in the best way I knew I could – through humour and retorted with sarcasm.”
She further revealed, “Soji and I are still happily married and I will not be discussing this issue any further.”
