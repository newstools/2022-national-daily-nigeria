The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi seems to be getting it hard as a coalition of both pasts and present Students’ Union leaders comprising of the NAN, NURSS and SUG in Rivers State has blasted Amaechi over what they call inhumane as the Minister and members of the All Progressives Congress, APC plan a Thanksgiving service in Port Harcourt on Saturday.
In a press release by the group, the group faulted the Minister of Transportation over the Thanksgiving which will be held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital days after the tragic incident on the Abuja-Kaduna railway which left scores dead, several injured and others as hostages in the hands of bandits and have left Nigerians mourning.
The group which questioned the rationale behind the planned thanksgiving service asked whether the Minister of Transportation is mocking victims of the Abuja-Kaduna railway incident.
Here are three questions of the group
1. Why is the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi organizing a Thanksgiving service in Rivers State?
2. Is the Thanksgiving an avenue to celebrate the sad tragedy that befall the nation and those who lost their lives?
3. Why spending billions of Naira for a special Thanksgiving service when the country is in and a bad mood and is in need of money to take care of families of those who lost their lives and those in the hospital?
4. What is the relationship between the death of those in the Abuja-Kaduna railway incident and the special Thanksgiving service?
According to the group, answers are needed to the many questions in their heart as it was unfair for the Minister to have organized such jamboree considering the state of the nation.
This blow is coming to the Minister few days after a coalition of Civil Society Organization called on the Minister to resign.
