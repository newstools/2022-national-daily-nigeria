Senator Shehu Sani has taken to his twitter page to suggest what will likely be the outcome of the presidential aspirants of the two major political parties, APC and PDP.
In his twitter post, Shehu Sani said “all said and done; the ruling party presidential candidate will be no other than who the president wants, and he shall be called consensus. The opposition presidential candidate will be a product of a deal stroked on the eve or the product of a bitter primaries”
In simpler terms, Shehu Sani believes that regardless of what happens, APC presidential candidate will be someone that is chosen by the president through consensus. While in the PDP, the presidential candidate would emerged as a result of deal or through a rigorous primary.
While several notable aspirants have declared their interest to run for president as the different political parties, there is still uncertainty with regards to the criteria that will be used in deciding who gets the ticket. Shehu Sani believes APC will get their presidential candidate through a consensus while the PDP will reach an agreement or decide to go into primaries.
