Some moments ago, the Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), was granted an interview by BBC News Pidgin. During the interview, he reacted to what Kano state’s Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said about him being a good loser in the 2023 presidential election.
Governor Nyesom Wike said, “what the media carried that day was just a part of the conversation we had. What I said before the Governor made the statement was that I know his party might leave power soon but I still need his support. We were all joking and that was what prompted his statement which the media carried.”
Governor Nyesom Wike again spoke about his presidential ambition noting that there is no aspirant in his political party who has political experiences more than him. He said he is certain there will be no consensus candidate during the primary election of his party.
