The news that former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adams Oshiomhole, has declared his intention to run for the Edo North Senatorial seat in 2023, surfaced recently after months of speculations. Unsurprisingly, this move has generated a considerable level of controversy within the party in the state and going by what is currently evident, there is the growing possibility that the former governor’s ambition may likely fall through due to some salient reasons.
Specifically, there appears to be a visible opposition to the former governor’s senatorial bid in some sections of the party. In a recent report published by the Vanguard Newspaper, several Exco members within the Edo North APC opposed Oshiomhole’s bid to represent the region in the senate. This is coming, despite the purported endorsement of his ambition by some leaders of the party within the state. Surely, with this growing opposition, it is hard to see how the APC chieftain will be able to navigate his way and win the seat at the end of the day.
More so, as it stands, Adams Oshiomhole will be running against the incumbent senator, Sen. Francis Alimikhena, who appears to be getting a strong support ahead of the 2023 general poll. Going by this support and his apparent power of incumbency, it will be difficult for anybody; even the likes of Oshiomhole; to upstage him at the forthcoming poll. One thing remains clear and that is; the odds are heavily stacked against him (Oshiomhole) ahead of the poll.
However, Oshiomhole has demonstrated his strong capacity to win political elections in the past and he may yet do so again in 2023, if he deploys the right tactics. The question is; does he still possess this capacity, especially considering his failure to help APC retain Edo state in 2020?
