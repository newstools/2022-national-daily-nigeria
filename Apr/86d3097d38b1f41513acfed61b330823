A federal high court presided over by Justice Binta Nyako held that the removed charges did not disclose any offence against the defendant.
While ruling on the preliminary objection seeking to quash the charges, the judge said, while counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the defendant, counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 15 shows some allegations, which the defendant has to answer.
“The court shall proceed to try the defendant on those counts,” she said.
Defence counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), had on February 22, 2022, moved the application seeking to quash charges for being defective, baseless, and incompetent.
But prosecution counsel asked the court to dismiss the application.
Kanu is facing charges bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony.
He was re-arrested I Kenya last year after jumping bail in 2017.
