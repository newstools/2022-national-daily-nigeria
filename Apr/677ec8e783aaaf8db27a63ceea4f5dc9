Manchester City’s hopes of winning the treble ended by a destructive Liverpool first half display at Wembley in their FA Cup semi-final.
City and Liverpool drew in an entertaining 2-2 draw in the Premier League six days ago to keep the Blues top of the table, and both sides progressed in the Champions League in midweek. Liverpool were able to rest seven key players though, while a full-strength City side were taken all the way by Atletico Madrid.
Pep Guardiola named Kevin De Bruyne in his squad but only on the bench, while Kyle Walker was not involved after both limped off against Atletico. Guardiola made seven changes to that side, and a full-strength Liverpool outfit made their freshness count.
