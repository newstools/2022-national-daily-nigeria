A presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has revealed that he will propose for changing of Nigeria’s name, if he eventually wins the forthcoming presidential election in the year 2023.
According to a tweet he made on his verified twitter handle, Adamu Garba made it known that they will rebrand the country properly, making it known that Nigeria will be renamed to “Nigritia Federation”. He went on and stated it clearly that “Nigritia” is our ancient name before lady Luggard renamed it Nigeria.
Speaking further, Adamu Garba made it known that time is right for us to clean ourselves from negative stereotypes, recognise ourselves and reclaim our country from colonial identities and divisions.
For some days now, Adamu Garba has been telling Nigerians what he will do if he is elected as the next president of the country. But be it as it may, let’s wait patiently and know whether Adamu Garba’s presidential ambition will eventually become a reality, come next year.
