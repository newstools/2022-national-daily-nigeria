A loaf of bread carrying the image of Asiwaju Bola Tinibu has been sighted on the internet and it has sent many people into laughter.
Apart from Tinibu’s photo, the bread also carries the image of a certain woman with the name “Olayinka Toluwanimi” who is believed to have sponsored the special campaign material.
Special campaign material
Asiwaju Tinibu is aspiring to be Nigeria’s president and the bread may be the latest addition to his campaign by his foot soldiers and supporters.
But the campaign item has thrown many into serious laughter with at least one person saying they will just eat the bread for nothing.
This is coming at a time when the presidential race is heating up with many people, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo throwing their hats into the ring.

“I feel disrespected that you think I would sell my votes to Tinubu for this rubbish. I have so much pride for beans and bread with Pepsi.. Am I a bricklayer? Instead of Pepsi, let them use LaCasera and Fearless and I will even gather my friends to vote for Tinubu too.”
