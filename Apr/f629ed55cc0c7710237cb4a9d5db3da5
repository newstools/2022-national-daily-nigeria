The former special assistant to former president Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has taken out his time to react to a certain tweet that was made by the present Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai in 2015, accusing former president Goodluck Jonathan of sponsoring Boko Haram.
While reacting, Reno Omokri made it known that Nasir El-Rufai accused former president Goodluck Jonathan of sponsoring Boko Haram, to reduce the population of the north.
Speaking further, Reno Omokri stated that El-Rufai is presently the governor of Kaduna State. He then made it clear that El-Rufai should now tell Nigerians who is sponsoring terrorism in his own state, Kaduna State.
Lately, Kaduna State has become the epic centre of terrorism in Nigeria. Several innocent Nigerians have been killed in that state within the last few months. Just few days ago, terrorists attacked a passenger train along Kaduna-Abuja railway, killing many and abducting many.
Based on what Reno Omokri just said here, I really think that El-Rufai should speak out and tell us who is sponsoring Boko Haram or bandits, just the same way he accused former president Goodluck Jonathan, years ago.
