Ex-BBNaija Star Tega Dominic just posted a 6-minute video to address the issue of the Chrisland saga which a 10-year old pupil was caught having a s£x romp after her mother claimed that she was gang r@ped by her classmates. The brand influencer expressed her unhappiness about the situation of things that are happening from the death of gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu to this current issue.
“I have been going through lots of comments, posts about this incident. At first when I saw it, you know saying the girl went to school and got r@ped I was very furious and then doing a lot of digging and all that. I’m literally pained, you can see my eyes which is, it’s something that has been messing with my emotions. How can a 10-year old as the family claim is going through such pain. Right. This child went to school and then school activities.”
“How manage wey Pikin wey be 10-year old? I didn’t see the video when I was furious. Something is wrong, something is actually wrong. These parent they need to ask questions. This girl can’t just wake up and be doing cowgirl come on, bare back, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl. How do you even place it and you call it r@pe. Because even in the video if you are listening to the video, some of her peers talking about, “OK this one is 10-years old, and this one is 13”
“Everything is mixed up so there were other people in the room and they were talking and laughing To be very honest here, I don’t want to point fingers and all that here but you cannot call that r@pe when this people were literally having fun. Something is wrong, something is wrong somewhere, there is a loophole somewhere either this girl is being abused or she is being exposed to some level of adult lifestyle and that starts from home”.
