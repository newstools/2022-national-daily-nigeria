One of the PDP presidential aspirants, Dele Momodu has taken to his official twitter page where he fired back at Bauchi state governor, Bala Mohammed over the statement he made regarding zoning of the PDP’s presidential ticket.
Recall that in a recent interview with Channels TV, Bala Mohammed, who also happens to be a PDP presidential aspirant said he does not believe in zoning ahead of the 2023 presidential elections but rather believes that the focus should simply be to find a leader who is capable of leading Nigeria.
He also said that the last president the Peoples Democratic Party produced was a southerner (Goodluck Jonathan) and that it is the time of the Northerners under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party to produce the next president of Nigeria. You can watch the interview from minutes 40:20 to 43:35 minutes to confirm.
But, Dele Momodu who did not agree with him on this, says; ” I disagree with gov Bala Mohammed on zoning. The last presidential aspirant of PDP was a Northerner, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, but he lost. So, the next slot should come down south”.
