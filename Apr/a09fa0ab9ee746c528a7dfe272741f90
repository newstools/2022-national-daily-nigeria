Notable stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for canvassing for unity of the party and consensus presidential candidate led by former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, were in Ibadan, Oyo State, for consultation with Governor Seyi Makinde on the PDP mission to rescue Nigeria from insecurity, economic woes, and other vices.
Saraki, after a meeting with Governor Seyi Makinde at the Government House, emphasized that what they are doing is to ensure all PDP stakeholders are united in the task to salvage the country from the current sordid situation.
Other PDP leaders at the meeting in Ibadan include Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, and Senator Aliyu Ayatudeen.
Saraki stated the need for unity of purpose among PDP leaders and members. He revealed that all presidential aspirants in the PDP are willing to accept consensus arrangement. He maintained that since the PDP is concentrating on providing credible and people-oriented government for Nigerians, all presidential aspirants are ready to abide with the position of the party. Saraki, by extrapolation, is willing to sacrifice his presidential aspiration to the decision of the PDP.
Governor Seyi Makinde acknowledged the success of meeting on the consensus arrangement. He appealed to Nigerians to show solidarity and support for the party, assuring that the PDP is working on presenting a presidential candidate that will be acceptable to all parts of the country.
Makinde stated that while the consensus negotiation looks appealing, PDP would ensure that people understand the arrangement, with proper clarification of any confusion that may arise.
