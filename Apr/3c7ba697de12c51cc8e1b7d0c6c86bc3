The symptoms of a stroke can appear from one part of the body to another, and depending on which part is affected, they manifest themselves differently.
However, there are some symptoms, according to experts, that can help identify this problem quickly, such as:
– An intense headache that comes on suddenly.
– Lack of strength on one side of the body, which is visible in the arm or leg.
– An asymmetrical face, with a crooked mouth and droopy eyebrows.
– Slurred speech, slow or with a very low and often imperceptible tone of voice.
– Loss of sensitivity of a part of the body, not identifying cold or heat, for example.
– Difficulty Standing or sitting because the body tilts to one side, making it impossible to walk or drag one of the legs.
– Vision changes, such as partial loss of vision or blurred vision.
– Difficulty lifting the arm or holding objects as the arm falls to one side.
– Unusual and uncontrolled movements, such as trembling, drowsiness, or even loss of consciousness.
– Loss of memory and mental confusion, not being able to carry out simple orders, such as opening the eyes, becoming aggressive and not being able to say the date or their name.
– Nausea and vomiting.
Despite this, a stroke can occur without causing any visible symptoms and can be discovered during an unrelated checkup.
The people who have a greater chance of having a stroke are those who have high blood pressure, are overweight or diabetic, and, therefore, they must make regular visits to the doctor to avoid this type of complication.
