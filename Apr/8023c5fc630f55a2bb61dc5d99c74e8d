Dikeh had in September 2021, during a clash with her ex, Prince Kpokpogri, indicated her interest in taking a drug test.
While offering to campaigns against drug abuse in universities and secondary schools, Dikeh said, “I don’t need funds for this, all I request is a comprehensive drug test carried out on me through your honourable office to enable me assist your good office as an individual and also help this country eradicate this pandemic called drugs.”
