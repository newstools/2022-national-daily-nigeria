The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has remained silent on zoning after the party’s committee on zoning of 2023 political offices has rounded up its duties and report ready for submission. The silence is also followed by the mobilization and advocacy for a consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential election by former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and some PDP governors and senators.
While Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Chairman of the Zoning Committee, said that the committee members have made a unanimous decision on zoning, he did not reveal the decision. Ortom only said that the report will be submitted to the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) for ratification.
The 37-member PDP zoning committee, inaugurated on March 24 by the National Working Committee (NWC), had the mandate of considering zoning the 2023 presidential ticket to any region, or making the contest for the PDP ticket open.
Other members of the committee include Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwunanyi of Enugu State, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, former Governors, lawmakers, and other party stalwarts.
There have been agitations for zoning the president to the south in 2023. Thie agitation generated strong opposition from the north.
