APC is selling its presidential forms for N100 million, a price which has been generating controversy.
A tweep #Mrcells said, “If only you lots bringing out this 100m could put it together to solve ASUU problems. We will forever praise you! But nope, it’s all greed for them.”
Another tweep, #elom2000 “I remember someone on this app tweeted in 2021 that we should watch this particular minister. #2023presidentialelection”
#Dhemmlardeh1 said, “It’s funny how all of Buhari’s ministers are able to afford 100m presidential form and Bubu is fighting corruption so hard.”
“100m is the new 1m. Seems everyone now have it except me,“ #babsomans said.
