The father of the controversial 10-year-old female student of Chrisland Schools has spoken for the first time following news of his daughter apologizing for her bad ways.
It was reported Monday the girl, who had a wild time in a Dubai hotel room during a sporting event in April, claimed on TikTok she had been pulled to the straight and narrow.
However, her father said it’s been two weeks since she touched a phone or used the Internet.
“My daughter has never touched the phone for the past two weeks. She has never touched anything Internet; those accounts are fake and we have deleted them as of Friday, 87 fake accounts. All of them are fake and they are imposters,” The Punch quoted him as saying.
Social media platforms do not allow anybody hurt delete or shut down somebody else’s account.
But he did not explain how he was able to close those fake accounts.
“We are surprised that they started going to pick a child’s picture; like a child will stay in the house and snap a picture and start posting it, so we closed the account,” he said.
“On Friday, I was coming from Panti (SCID), I was with my daughter in the car; my wife and lawyer were in the car and we were driving home when a friend called me that my daughter was chatting now. I said which chatting, my daughter is with me now and doesn’t have any phone with her. I said we are together and somebody is chatting and it is not my daughter.”
The father also blamed the school management for keeping the matter away from the family for over a month.
