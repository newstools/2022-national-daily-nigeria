A well known Nigerian human right activist and social commentator, Adeyanju Deji has taken to his official Facebook page to react after a Facebook user identified as Charles Asebowale AdebaNjo accused him of collecting money from Atiku Abubakar.
A Facebook user identified as Charles Asebowale AdebaNjo took to his Facebook page to drag Adeyanju Deji, claiming that he collected money from Atiku Abubakar during his time, and now he is encouraging delegates to take more money, adding that when the primary election results come out, he (Charles Asebowale AdebaNjo) hope that Deji won’t put the blame on them.
Reacting to this statement, the former Head of News Media for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Adeyanju Deji made it known that Charles Asebowale’s statement was a beautiful one, adding that if he has ever collected one Kobo from Atiku Abubakar in his life, may it not be well with him, and anything he put his hands in will not succeed.

This is sad and unfortunate, I don’t see any reason why Nigerians will be accusing others without any proof. A lot of Nigerians have been claiming that Adeyanju Deji is being paid by Atiku Abubakar to criticize other politicians running for the 2023 Presidential election, however, looking at his statement, Deji made it clear that he have never collected one Kobo from Atiku.
