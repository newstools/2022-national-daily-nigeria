An Ace investigative journalist, Babajide Kolade-otitoju, has shared the story of a former Nigerian governor who tried to discourage a governorship aspirant during his tenure in office. Babajide revealed that the former governor had boasted about having access to state funds at the time.
Sharing the story, Babajide said, “We have made our politics in such a way that people without money cannot get involved. A governor at the time confronted a governorship aspirant who intended to contest against him. The governor boasted that he had spent N3 billion to win his election and was ready to spend N8 billion to keep his seat. The governor advised the governorship aspirant to avoid wasting his money because he would not win. Indeed, the aspirant did not even come close to winning. The politician in question is a former governor of a state in the North East.
He continued, “People spend over N1 billion to become senators. It should not continue. I do not want to mention the year of the incident.”
