Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on Saturday formally declared to contest the 2023 presidential election. The Kogi governor had declared for the presidential race on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) amidst debate and demands for zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket to the south.
Governor Bello has, however, maintained that the ruling APC should field competent candidate for the presidential election and do away with the issue of zoning.
Governor Bello will have to contest for the APC ticket with the APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, amongst others.
The declaration activities are still going on at the time of this report.
Details later.
