The report also said a source close to Tinubu revealed that Tinubu’s move was to preserve his interest ahead of the APC’s presidential primary election. The idea was that if Tinubu supported Senator Sani to become the national chairman of the APC, in return, the Senator would use his influence as national chairman to ensure that Tinubu got the 2023 presidential ticket of the party.
However, Tinubu’s game plan was ruined when President Buhari adopted Abdullahi Adamu as his preferred candidate for the national chairmanship position and convinced other contenders to step down for him. With Buhari’s support, Adamu eventually emerged as the National Chairman of the APC

How did Amaechi beat Tinubu at his game?
According to speculations, it was Amaechi who sold the candidacy of the new national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, to president Buhari.
It was alleges that Amaechi was the one who convinced Adamu to join the chairmanship race. He also promised to use his resources and influence in Aso Rock to ensure that the president backed Adamu for the position and in return, Adamu would use his influence as national chairman of the party to ensure that he (Amaechi) get the 2023 presidential ticket of the party.
It can be said that Amaechi has beaten Tinubu at his own game. Tinubu wanted the national chairman of the party to be someone who would be amenable to his interest, however, he has failed as Amaechi has successfully ‘installed’ his own man who will work for his (Amaechi) interest.
