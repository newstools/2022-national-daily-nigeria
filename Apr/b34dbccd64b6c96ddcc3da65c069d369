What are the symptoms of a deficiency in folic acid in the body?
1. Constant diarrhea; if you’re having or suffering from diarrhea more frequently than usual, you should get a checkup to see if your folate levels are still high; a shortage of folate in the blood can cause constant diarrhea.

4. Muscular weakness
