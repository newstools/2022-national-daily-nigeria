“The visit opened a vista for enhanced military relations between Nigeria and Oman.”
In appreciation of the visit, Saidi stated that an Omani sailing vessel would be made to embark on a two yearly flag tour to Nigeria and West Africa for the first time.

In continuation of her maiden voyage, NNS KADA’s next port of call would be Mombasa, Kenya, he said.
The director expressed optimism that the induction of NNS KADA into the Nigerian Navy fleet would no doubt play a critical role in sealift of troops and maritime crises management.
“Especially in conveying relief materials within the nation’s waterways, thereby contributing significantly to the promotion of humanitarian assistance within West Africa and beyond,” the statement added.
