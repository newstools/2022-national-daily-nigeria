A popular Nigerian politician and staunch member of the All Progressives Congress, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page and reacted to the news that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has allegedly joined the APC political party to contest the 2023 presidential election.
It was gathered that former President of Nigeria, Good Luck Ebele Jonathan has allegedly defected to the All Progressives Congress to contest against Bola Tinubu, Osinbanjo, Amaechi, and others for the 2023 presidential election.
Reacting to the report, the Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo-Olu on Drainage and Water Resources, Joe Igbokwe, took to his Facebook page and that people should perish the thought that Good Luck Jonathan would contest on the platform of APC as he affirmed that such a joke is taken too far.
According to Joe Igbokwe, he said: “Goodluck Jonathan for president on the platform of APC? Perish the thought, this is a joke taken too far”.
Looking at Joe Igbokwe’s reaction, it seems like he is frightened and he does not believe that Good Luck Jonathan would defect to APC to contest the presidency against Tinubu.
