He stated this on Monday in Abuja, in an interview with newsmen shortly after meeting with 12 APC governors.
The meeting at Kebbi Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro in Abuja, came hours after Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo joined the 2023 presidential race.
Asked to comment on the declaration of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is seen by many as his political son, for presidency, Tinubu simply said, “I don’t have any son grown up enough to make such a declaration.”
He, however, said his meeting with state governors on the platform of the party to seek collaboration, support and encouragement concerning his 2023 presidential ambition.
