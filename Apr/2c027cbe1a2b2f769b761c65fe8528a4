Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu sounded stunned by the outcome of the match for he said, “what a match! Congratulations to the madridistas.”
The Presidential hopeful also shared some pictures showing the moment he was watching the match between the two great clubs.
During the match, Thomas Tuchel’s squad did all they could by leading on the scoreboard for the second leg but the aggregate of the first leg and the recent one quenched the club’s champions league thirst.
