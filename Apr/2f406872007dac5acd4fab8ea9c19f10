The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has requested Muslims in Nigeria to pray for the security of the country as Ramadan begins across the world.
Senate President Lawan had stated: “I felicitate all Nigerians, particularly, the Muslim Ummah, as we enter the Holy Month of Ramadan.
“Ramadan is the month when Muslims across the world observe one of the five pillars of their faith, share with their neighbours and show love to all people around them.
“It is a period of spiritual reflection, abstinence, sacrifice, and supplications to the Almighty Allah. The holy month of Ramadan thus provides the faithful the opportunity to commune with Allah and live as His Prophets enjoin us to do as we seek His blessings and mercies … For our Muslim compatriots, let us use the opportunity of Ramadan to pray for Nigeria, knowing that Allah answers the prayers of the faithful.”
Lawan maintained that the essence of the period is even more significant for the people as they seek solutions and divine guidance out of the challenges facing the country.
The senate president assured that the Federal Government is doing everything possible to ameliorate the situation, saying that much more has to be done.
