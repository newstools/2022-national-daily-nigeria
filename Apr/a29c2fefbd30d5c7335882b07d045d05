The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential aspirant Bola Tinubu has blamed the incessant power failures assailing the country’s economy on the previous administration’s failure to heed his advice.
Tinubu who made this revelation while speaking at a parley on Wednesday disclosed how he brought in major investors into the country.
The former governor boasted that he was the first governor to introduce the Independent Power Project in Nigeria.
“I am the first governor to bring Independent Power Project (IPP) to Nigeria. It was 300 megawatts. If they had followed my advice then, Nigeria will not be facing epileptic power supplies,” the former Lagos governor said.
Mr Tinubu, who has formally entered the presidential election race for 2023, hailed himself as the most qualified candidate, adding that his dream is for a country that is not a poverty index.

Nigeria’s power grid collapsed last Friday, the third time in less than four weeks.
In the wake of the latest grid collapse,  Minister of Power Abubakar Aliyu on Saturday announced that an investigation had been launched into the recurring collapse.
On his part, works minister Tunde Fashola blamed unnamed vandals for the nationwide blackout reported after the national grid collapsed that occurred on Friday evening.
