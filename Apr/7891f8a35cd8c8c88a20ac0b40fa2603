IPOB yielded to the appeal by the Anambra Government and traditional rulers to pave the way for peace since all Igbo stakeholders and religious leaders have declared their intention to find a lasting solution to insecurity and incessant sit-at-home directives in the South East.
The decision was disclosed by the Chairman, Anambra Traditional Rulers Council, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, during one-day peacebuilding and security meeting held in Awka on Saturday.
Igwe Achebe, who is also the Obi of Onitsha, said after its meeting with the group on Friday, April 1, it was agreed that a call to release the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, would be a step toward dousing the tension in the state.
He said that after the meeting, the group placed a call to all its members to sheathe their swords, put down their guns and go the way of dialogue.
