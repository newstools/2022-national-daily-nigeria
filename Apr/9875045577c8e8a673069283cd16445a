Khafi Kareem, a former housemate of reality TV show, Big Bro Naija, is facing a misconduct probe at the UK’s Met Police over her appearance at the 2019 edition of the show.
Recall that in 2019, Scotland Yard had said it had not granted Ms Kareem’s request to appear on the programme and that an internal investigation would be carried out.
The Met said Ms Kareem was granted unpaid leave for an “unrelated reason” ahead of appearing on the show but her request to take part in the programme was denied.
According to a report on BBC, Kareem, a police constable at the Met Police, faced a panel on Monday, where she revealed that she took and surrendered her laptop to organizers of the reality TV show.

The Met police officer had told her superior she wanted to appear on Big Brother Naija to ‘promote the Met police’ globally.
During the hearing, it was reported that Khafi denied allegations of breaching standards in respect of ‘orders and instructions’ and ‘discreditable conduct’ and failing to declare business interest in relation to publicity and promotion of the show.
She spent 77 days in the Big Brother Naija house before she was evicted. The hearing held at the Empress Building in West London on Monday
Since the show, Khafi has gone on to marry a fellow housemate, Gedoni Epata and they have a son.
Kareem joined the force as a Pc based at Lambeth station in 2015, having worked part-time as a special constable for four years. She was also a former bit-part actress and shop assistant.
