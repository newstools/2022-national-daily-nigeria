This is contained in a statement signed by Mr Benjamin Mordi, Manager, Media and Public Relations, BSN, on Friday in Lagos.
Mordi said that the society would use the ocassion to distribute free Bibles to schools and individuals.
He said that the National Bible Day was set aside to celebrate the gift of the bible to Christendom and humanity at large.
Mordi quoted the General Secretary/Chief Executive Officer of the society, Pastor Samuel Sanusi, as urging Nigerians to use the day to reflect on and imbibe the values prescribed by the Holy Book.
Sanusi said that the BSN believes that the Bible has the solutions to man’s problems, vices, and challenges, especially when its values are imbibed by the youths, who are the future of the nation.
According to Sanusi, our socio-economic and security challenges as a nation will be greatly reduced if people adopt and live by prescribed biblical principles in all human relations.
Sanusi said that if the global community could celebrate Workers’ Day, Independence Day, Water Day, Literacy Day, and other days, it would be ideal to also use a day to celebrate the Bible, a gift from God to humanity and pray for the wellbeing of the nation.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the BSN is a not-for-profit interdenominational Christian organisation.
The BSN has the mandate to translate the Bible into local languages, publish, and distribute the scripture, as well as raise funds for the Bible work and execution of life transforming programmes.
The BSN has translated the full Bible in 26 Nigerian languages, while Bible translation/revision is ongoing in 10 Nigerian languages.
It will cost the organisation minimum of N120 million to achieve a Bible translation project, if completed in 12 years.
