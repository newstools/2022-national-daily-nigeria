Nigeria is facing some level of insecurity as many have died and others have been kidnapped for ransom. This scenario has been a major concern for the current government and many Nigerians.Human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, took to his Facebook page to enquire about what was happening in Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria. The activist question came after an alleged story of how some kidnappers invaded the Gobrawa community in the polytechnic environment, which had reportedly caused panic and tension in the school environment.Although the Student Union Government of the Polytechnic has claimed that the kidnappers’ invading news is currently unverified, and advised that students should stay calm.
It will be of concern to note that some days ago, a train was attacked by bandits along the Abuja-Kaduna rail, which led to the death of some people, while others were kidnapped by the bandits, and their whereabouts have not been found till this moment.
