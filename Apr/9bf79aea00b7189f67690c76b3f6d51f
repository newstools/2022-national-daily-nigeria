The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, attended a Jumat Prayer in Abuja today, April 22, 2022.
The former governor of Lagos State was seen in the mosque with other Muslim worshippers. Tinubu also met with the leaders of the mosque shortly after the Jumah service.
The presidential aspirant was welcomed by a mammoth crowd when he arrived at the mosque. Tinubu used the opportunity to woo the worshippers to support his 2023 presidential bid.
Also, APC women leaders from the six geo-political zones paid a courtesy visit to Tinubu at his Abuja residence today. The progressive women declared their support for the presidential bid of the former governor.
Tinubu had earlier visited the former governor of Yobe State, Alhaji Ibrahim Geidam, at his Abuja residence before going for Jumat Prayer.
The former governor had earlier declared his intention to run for president on the platform of the All Progressives Congress in 2023, and he has been consulting with stakeholders across the country.
