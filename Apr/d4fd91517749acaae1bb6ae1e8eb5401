Former Imo state governor and Senator representing Imo West, has said President Muhammadu Buhari may surprise everyone by his choice of presidential hopeful.
In January, Buhari said the name of his preferred presidential candidate would remain a secret.
The president added that his “favourite” for the presidency in 2023 will be “eliminated” if he mentions the person’s name.
Speaking on Wednesday in an interview with Channels Television, Okorocha, a presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said the president is “unpredictable”, and that Buhari has not revealed his favourite presidential pick.
The former Imo governor said Buhari will consider certain factors before he endorses any politician for the 2023 presidency.

“But if you know President Muhammadu Buhari, he is a general. You can’t predict him. He is so unpredictable that you cannot predict what he will do. He might pull anybody by surprise anytime,” he said.
“That gives him the military training that he has. Anybody (referring to presidential hopefuls) that meets him, whatever he says to A, the same thing he will say to B.
“If anybody comes out to say, Buhari has endorsed him, the person will not be telling the truth. The president may have his preferred candidate in his chest. He has not made that known to anybody.
“The President Buhari, I know, will want to check the mood of the nation. He will also consider the interest of the people.
“He will also consider who can win the election for the party. President Buhari in making his decision will be guided by so many issues that he has to consider.”
