Ukraine’s president said the military situation in the south and east was “still very difficult”, while praising the work of his armed forces.
“The successes of our military on the battlefield are really significant, historically significant. But they are still not enough to clean our land of the occupiers,” he said in a late-night video address, calling again for allies to send heavier weapons and for an international embargo on Russian oil.
Zelenskiy, speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper, assessed that about 10,000 of his soldiers had been injured in the war so far, and that up to 20,000 Russian soldiers had died.
Moscow said last month that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded. There is no way yet to independently verify either claim.
