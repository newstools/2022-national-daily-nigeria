A presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has dragged the Vice President of the country, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, after he recently declared his presidential ambition, stating it clearly that he (Osinbajo) betrayed a man who supported and nurtured him.
According to a tweet he made on his verified twitter handle, Adamu Garba started by making it know that politics is the most serious business of human society, stating it clearly that anyone with low moral is not expected to come close to it.
Speaking further, he made it known that when someone can betray a man who supported, nurtured and built him, it means that the person can also betray the whole world shamelessly, when given the opportunity.
It should be recalled that the Vice President of the country, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, recently declared his intention to contest for presidency. By making this declaration, it simply means that he will contests against Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in order to get the APC presidential ticket.
