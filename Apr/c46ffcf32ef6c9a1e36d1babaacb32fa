President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family of former Minister of Aviation, Alabo Graham-Douglas who died on Monday at the ripe age of 82.
Graham-Douglas was appointed Minister of Labour and Productivity in 1999.
He also served in the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo as Minister of Tourism.
The Rivers State indigene was born on May 8, 1939, in Abonnema in the Akuku-Toro Local Government Area.
Buhari’s condolence message is contained in a statement signed late Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled ‘President Buhari mourns Alabo Tongue Graham Douglas’.
According to Adesina, “President Buhari sympathises with the Government and people of Rivers State over the loss of the political stalwart, democrat and administrator, who served differently as Minister of Aviation, Minister of Labour and Productivity, and Minister of Tourism, leaving a legacy of distinguished service to the nation.
“The President notes the historic roles Alabo Graham-Douglas played in entrenching democratic rule and liberal culture, joining well-meaning Nigerians and global leaders to stand and speak for justice and fairness, while promoting grassroots development among his people.
“President Buhari believes the investments of the departed in people and building of institutions will be remembered by posterity.”
He, therefore, prayed that the Almighty God will grant his soul a peaceful rest, and comfort his family.
