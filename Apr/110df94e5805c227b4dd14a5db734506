Do you know that liver failure doesn’t just happen out of the blues? There are certain signs your body will show you when the liver is no longer functioning as it should either due to a disease or something else worthy of attention and if you adamantly ignore these signs, then the liver fails putting your life on a 50-50 situation.
In this article in line with a publication on Mayo Clinic, we are going to have a look at some of the signs a person may notice before the liver fails completely. Just sit tight and enjoy this article while learning something new.
What Are The Signs A Person May Notice Before A Liver Failure?
1. Skin changes in colour – this has to do with the yellowing of the skin due to a condition known as jaundice. A person may suffer jaundice when the liver is not functioning well and as such causing bile to leak into the blood stream.
2. Itchy skin – due to the fact that liver is no longer able to get rid of some toxic substances from the body, it may cause the toxic and unhealthy substances to accumulate in the blood causing constant itchy skin and even rashes.
3. Dark urine colour may also be a sign of liver failure or serious liver related disease that is capable of causing total failure. If your urine is always dark in colour even after drinking enough water, then you should consider seeing a doctor.
4. Swelling in the legs and feet due to accumulation of fluid in the extremities. This happens when the liver is not able to properly get rid of liquid substances or excess fluid from the body. So endeavour to see a doctor if you notice unusual swelling of the legs and feet.
