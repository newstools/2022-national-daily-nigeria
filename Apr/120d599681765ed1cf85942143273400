Rainfall lightning has caused mystery deaths, striking four youths who were playing football while the rain was falling to instant death. The deceased were killed by the lightening in Ago Dada, a local community in Akure North Local Government Area, Ondo State.
The deceased identified as non-indigenes of the community, were said to be playing football in the rain when a thunderbolt struck last Thursday evening.
The incident was said to have precipitated mass protest by residents of the community seeking explanations to the mystery deaths.  The people wanted to know why the gods were that angry.
It was gathered that some elders and traditionalists later performed certain rites and rituals in the community to appease the gods.
