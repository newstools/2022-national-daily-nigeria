Activist and Convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, has given two cogent reasons why Igbo people who occupy the South Eastern Nigeria should produce next Nigeria’s President.
Adeyanju, who is known for being critical of government decisions and policies, made his stance while granting an exclusive interview to Saturday Punch as he insisted that it is the turn of Igbo to produce number one man to paddle the affairs of the country in 2023, adding that no region should be made superior over others.
According to him, it would be fair for the two main leading political parties (APC and PDP) in the spirit of fairness and equity to zone their presidential tickets to the South East.
He said an Igbo person should be our next president and that no region has more stakes than the other.
Adeyanju cited two main reasons for his stance on an Igbo man being next president of Nigeria. One of the reasons he gave is that the Igbo people are business inclined. He said because the Igbo know how to do business, they will create lots of business opportunities for the country if an Igbo person is voted in.
On his second reason for rooting for an Igbo presidency, he said electing an Igbo man to lead the country will definitely heal the country across the divides. According to him, electing an Igbo person as the President of Nigeria would not be a right step in right direction but the first step to achieving national unity.
