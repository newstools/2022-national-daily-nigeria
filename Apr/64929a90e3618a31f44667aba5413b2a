People were already wondering what the former governor meant running about before he declared his intention to vie for the APC presidential ticket.
But the minister, who was in Ile Ife to consult the Ooni of Ife on Monday, said he took the decision just to convince himself.
“Age will not be an issue. I am like a bridge between the young and the old,” Amaechi said.
“People have asked me why I ran round the stadium, I was checking to see how fit I am, so I had to run round the stadium to confirm to myself that I’m strong enough to carry the problems of the country, whether it is mentally or physically.
“Because you need both mental capacity and physical fitness to manage this country.
“You have to be physically strong and have the mental capacity to make decisions on behalf of the country,” he stated.
His boss and President Muhammadu Buhari has been criticised for taking on the responsibility of leading Nigeria when he knows he’s in bad shape.
