There are strong indications that the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, might support the presidential ambition of the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo
It was reliably gathered that that the Minister who is engaged in a feud with his former godfather, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, might be part of the Osinbajo support movement as the faction loyal to him in Osun State described the VP as a friend and hailed him on Monday.
According to one of the aides of Osinbajo who craved anonymity, Aregbesola is part of their team, adding that in the next few days, Nigerians will know.
The leadership of the Osun APC faction loyal to ex-governor Aregbesola, described Osinbajo as a ‘friend of the movement.’

However, the Publicity Secretary of the faction, Abiodun Agboola, while speaking further, said the progressive family in Osun had not decided who to support among the presidential aspirants.
Agboola also said that the faction believed in Osinbajo but insisted that “the Osun Progressive has not officially taken a position, but the Vice-president is very close to the leadership of the group. Very soon the group will state an official position.
His words, “We believe in the Vice-president going by his antecedents and what he has been able to achieve in this administration with his loyalty to the President and the party as a whole. We are happy that he has finally declared his intention to run for the presidential position.”
Asked if Aregbesola would work for Osinbajo’s emergence as the APC candidate, Sola Fasure, the media adviser to the minister, said his principal had not indicated who he was going to work for.
“He (Aregbesola) has not indicated who is going to work for. The situation is still unfolding,” he said.
