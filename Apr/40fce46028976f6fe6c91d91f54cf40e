Solomon stated this when he received leaders of the Christian Political Leaders Forum (CPLF) on Saturday in Asaba.
He noted that political power is second to the power of God, and charged members of the group to continue to champion the move in encouraging Christians to take political leadership roles.
“For Christians to exclude themselves in politics is a serious undoing. For so long, they have overlooked the political terrain erroneously thinking that politic a dirty game.
“Christians should be involved in politics because the change we are craving for can only be effected when we are involved in the system. Staying away from political system is self-imposed limitation,” he stated.
According to the former commissioner, Christian Political Leaders Forum is designed to sensitize Christians that Christianity is more than praying, singing and wining souls.
“I want to use this medium to inform Christians that another transition is around the corner and you must key into it by getting your Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) and party cards. This is a PDP State and we will never hand over to another party.
“We must support and pray for God to give Gov. Okowa clear vision and direction in order to record a seamless transition, not only to finish strong in infrastructural and human capital development but politically as well,” he added.
While commending the group for its achievements and structural spread across the state, he charged them not to relent in the drive.
Highlight of the event was the presentation of a register containing the names of members of CPFL in the state to the Convener by the National Coordinator of CPFL, Mr Emeke Egwuanimkwu.
