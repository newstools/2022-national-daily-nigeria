Reno Omokri slams the presidency for releasing Dariye and Nyame, who allegedly had criminal cases. He also criticised the rehabilitation of repentant Boko Haramists. According to Reno, these guys stole billions from the public coffers and do not deserve to be pardoned.
In a twitter post, Reno Omokri slams Buhari government for realising Dariye and Nyame who stole billions instead pursue freedom fighters. He opposed how the government go after freedom fighters like Nnamdi kanu, Igbogho and Zakzaky while pardoning boko haram terrorists and criminals who stole billions.
From what Reno said, he feels that it is incomprehensible how these things play out. Could there be more to this? Is the government complacent when it comes to the cases of some groups in the country.
Judging from Reno Omokri’s tone, there is no justification for prosecuting freedom fighters whereas terrorist boko haram and alleged criminals are being pardoned.
