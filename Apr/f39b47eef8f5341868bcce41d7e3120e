Heart failure, the medical term for a weak heart where the heart no longer pumps as well as it should, can be frightening for some people.
In this case, the blood that the heart should keep pumping flows back into the lungs causing shortness of breath, a dry cough, or acute pulmonary oedema.
Symptoms of a weak heart:
– Urinary changes: you start to pee very little or wake up a lot at night to pee.
– You may faint because of arrhythmia or low cardiac output (not enough blood reaching the brain).
– Swelling in the legs and feet.
– Shortness of breath.
– Fatigue and weakness.
– Rapid heartbeat because the heart needs to speed up to compensate for that deficit in pumping blood properly throughout the body.
– Persistent cough because of excess fluid in the lungs or pleura, which surrounds the lungs. It can have white, frothy, or pinkish mucus.
– Wheezing.
– Chest pain if the person has coronary heart disease.
– Nausea and lack of appetite when the liver becomes swollen.
– Bluish skin on hands and lips.
