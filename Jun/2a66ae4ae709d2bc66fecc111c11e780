Popular Human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu has expressed her reaction to EFCC statement that any landlord who rents their house to Yahoo Boys risk 15 years in jail. Aisha Yesufu wasn’t pleased with the statement because it’s not very easy to identify Yahoo Boys when they come to rent an apartment.
It can be recalled that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC in its bid to curb the menace of Yahoo Boys (Internet fraudsters) in the country, including those who have upgraded to Yahoo plus, announced recently that any Landlord who rents their house to Yahoo boys risk spending 15 years in jail.

Aisha Yesufu while expressing her reaction, wrote on Twitter, I am a landlady. Since 2007. If I am to spend 15 years in jail for giving my house to yahoo boys (on whose forehead it is not written that they are yahoo) then all members of @officialEFCC @ICPC_PE @PoliceNG who are paid to arrest & prosecute them should get life imprisonment!
