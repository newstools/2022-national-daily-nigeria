A Twitter user identified as Big Sanious recently took to his social media page (Twitter) to talk about Bola Tinubu. He said Tinubu is playing tribal politics and those who are supporting him are Hausa Fulani.
According to the Twitter user, “Tinubu is playing tribal politics even though the people who are 100% in his support are Hausa Fulani, and the people who’re 10000% against him are his people.” This is a record we have because the future hoards misinformation and blameshifts.”
This is coming from what the All Progressives Congress presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, claimed in his speech that President Buhari would not be where he is if not for him.
Recall that Bola Tinubu declared his intention to run for president under the All Progressives Congress. The party primary election is yet to be held.
