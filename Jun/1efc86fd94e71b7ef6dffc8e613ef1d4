The criminals reportedly entered through the rear of the estate around 3am.
Patrick Simon, estate security supervisor, said the gunmen took away laptops, mobile phones, smart television sets, and other valuables from the house.
“There were about 20 of them. They broke the door and stole laptops, phones, Plasma TVs, and other valuables,” he added.
He denied anyone was kidnapped.
The FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, also confirmed the incident.
“It was a burglary, and we’re currently on their trail,” she added.
“Upon our arrival on the estate, the robbers took to their heels upon being chased by our officers, and that led to them abandoning some items they had already stolen, including some phones and laptops.”
