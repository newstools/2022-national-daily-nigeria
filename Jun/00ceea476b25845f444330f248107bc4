In a latest statement released by Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant who wants to contest for the presidency under the umbrella of the All Progressive Congress, APC, on Thursday while speaking with the party delegates in Abeokuta, Ogun State, revealed that he did his best to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari becomes the president, and that it is his turn now to become the president.
Many Nigerians have reacted to this statement released by Bola Tinubu. Amongst them is a twitter user named Seun, who stated that if President Buhari would atleast not support Tinubu at the primaries, the best he can do for someone who has supported him is to atleast stay neutral and allow an open contest, inorder to give everyone a fair chance.
in reaction to this statement released by Seun, a popular social media influencer, Omojuwa faulted him, as he noted that we can’t ask a president to be neutral in the process of choosing his successor. He also noted that even Tinubu isn’t asking for Neutrality, but he is asking to be backed by the President.
