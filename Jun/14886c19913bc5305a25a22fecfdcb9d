Popular comedian and Human Rights Activist Mr. Macaroni tool to Twitter to reply Adeyanju Deji after he advised Rabiu Kwankwaso and Peter Obi, the presidential candidates of New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Labour Party (LP) to leave social media and campaign offline.
According to Comrade Deji Adeyanju, Peter Obi has structure on Twitter while Kwankwaso has structure on Facebook, but the they do not have structures on ground in all the geopolitical zones in Nigeria.

He advised that both presidential candidates should leave social media campaign and go and engage politicians offline, in a bid to form an alliance and defeat the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Mr. Macaroni reacted to his message saying that campaign on social media was very sweet to a lot of people in 2015. He noted that he doesn’t understand why people are suddenly asking others to leave social media, because people will always campaign online.
According to Mr. Macaroni, the campaign on social media doesn’t stop the work going on offline, because it is a plus and not a minus for the politicians ambitions. See the conversation below.
In my opinion, Deji Adeyanju is right, but his message is getting misunderstood. He is trying to point out the fact that grassroots campaign is a more viable option, considering the state of Nigeria’s politics at the moment. Mr. Macaroni’s statement is also right, as all the politicians needs to do is to get more hand on deck to carry on with the offline/grassroots campaign simultaneously as the online campaign.
