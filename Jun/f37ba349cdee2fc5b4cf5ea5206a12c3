The Organising Secretary of the association, Apagun Kole Omololu, in a statement, said the incident was a direct attack on the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, as well as Yoruba land.
“It is directed at Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for his unflinching support for security in Yoruba land by championing the Amotekun security outfits, his stringent upholding of the open grazing law, and for his ‘big mouth’ about Southern co-operation for equity and justice in Nigeria,” Omololu said in the statement.
“We will not succumb to terrorist threats or attacks.
“They will not be allowed to bring down our civilisation. We will hunt the killers down. Citizens should not take law into their own hands by attacking innocent northerners. Only the terrorists, who are mostly foreign Fulani, should be fished out and finished off by the security forces.
“This attack is to cause confusion and cause war in our land. We should not play into their hands. This evil is condemned in the strongest term.
“We commiserate with the government and people of Ondo State, the Catholic Church, the Olowo of Owo and the people of Owo. May the soul of the departed rest in peace.”
The attack Sunday, in which no fewer than 50 died, has jolted states across the southwest.
Ondo Gov Akeredolu, in whose hometown the attack took place, has vowed to spare no resources in hunting down the killers.
