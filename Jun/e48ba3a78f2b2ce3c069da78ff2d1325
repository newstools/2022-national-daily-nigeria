Omo-Agege’s congratulatory message is contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Wednesday by Mr Ima Niboro, Director, Communications and Media Strategy, Delta APC Gubernatorial Campaign Organisation.
Omo-Agege, the standard bearer of APC in the 2023 governorship election in Delta, expressed optimism that Tinubu would emerge victorious at the 2023 presidential election.
He lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Working Committee of the APC for giving all aspirants a level playing field.
He commended the 2022 APC Special Convention Committee for successfully conducting the primary election.
Omo-Agege also showered glowing tributes on APC governors in the north of Nigeria for setting the pace by zoning the presidency to the South.
He called on Tinubu to be magnanimous in victory and stressed the need for all presidential aspirants to join hands with the APC’s presidential candidate and the party in ensuring victory.
“Not everyone gave APC a chance to conduct a free, fair and credible presidential primary election. With the undercurrents in the build-up, some had predicted that our great party would go into extinction after this convention.
“With the transparent process that saw the emergence of Asiwaju Tinubu as our party’s standard bearer, I am confident more than ever before that this is the beginning of even greater tidings for our party.
“We proved our critics wrong. We have shown that with unity of purpose, the sky is our starting point,’’ he said.
Omo-Agege also called on Nigerians to support Tinubu and other APC candidates at all levels at the 2023 general elections.
