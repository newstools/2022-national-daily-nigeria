“The carnage, which involved children, women and men was unwarranted, inhuman, disastrous and a product of degenerated minds and lost souls. I call on the security agencies to expedite steps to bring the perpetrators to book.
“This killing is one too many, especially now that peace is gradually returning to this South-West part of the country through the activities South-West Security Network, code named Amotekun.
“This heinous crime was deliberately orchestrated and executed by agents of chaos to test the resolve of the government and people of Ondo State to secure the lives and properties of its citizens,” he said.
He called on the citizens of the state, especially those living along the border with sister states, to be security conscious and not to also lower their guards, saying, “we are in perilous times and this ugly incident portends a greater danger to come.”
He appealed to the people of Owo not to take the laws into their hands, and on behalf of Ilaje people home and abroad, commiserated with those that lost loved ones and wished the injured speedy recovery.
