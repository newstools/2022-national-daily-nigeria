The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Right Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, decried loss of party tickets by 178 members of the House at the primaries of the various political parties in the country.
The Speaker in his opening remarks at the resumption of plenary on Tuesday, lamented that about 178 serving members of the House of Representatives were defeated at the primaries of their respective parties and lost the ticket to return to the National Assembly in 2023.
Gbajabiamila lamented: “many members lost because of the process of primaries, using the delegate system which is what the House fought for by making direct primaries compulsory in the Electoral Act which the President has yet to sign.
“That clause of the Electoral Act had to be expunged, allowing political parties to decide their mode of primaries to select their candidates for various elections.”
