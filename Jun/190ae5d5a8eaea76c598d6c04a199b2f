Media personality, Ifedayo Olarinde alias Daddy Freeze has reacted after a media troll took to his comment section to describe him as a fool.

Recall that the former Cool FM broadcaster was on the news a couple of days back after he attacked Nathaniel Bassey over his Jesus challenge that went viral.
Daddy Freeze had accused the gospel artist cum preacher of trying to utilize the opportunity to trend and possibly make more money as the case may be.
In a recent development, an Instagram user identified by his handle as mayorsings took to the comment section to pen a very derogatory statement about Daddy Freeze while claiming that he comes in peace and doesn’t intend to trigger uproars.

Daddy Freeze who doesn’t deal with issues like such lightly responded in a very fierce manner. Daddy Freeze extended the insult to the man’s father and share the screenshot on his page.
