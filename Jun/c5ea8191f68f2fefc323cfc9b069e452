Reno Omokri Dares Tinubu to take him to court, accusing the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress of engaging in a Heroin drug ring in the United States of America.
According to Reno Omokri, Bola Tinubu was involved in a Heroin drug ring in the US between 1991 to 1993.
In a Twitter post, Reno Omokri questioned the sanity of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its members, asking to know why the party would ask Nigerians to vote for Bola Tinubu who he accused of having a Heroin forfeiture case, as the next President of Nigeria.
He claimed that his accusation on Tinubu’s involvement in a drug deal is not a charge, accusation, or a rumour, but a fact. He said that his claim is an actual judicial forfeiture of drug linked funds. He asked, “how can a man linked with the drug trade be the president of Nigeria?”
Reno Omokri said that a man like Bola Tinubu who has a drug linked case in the United States will be vulnerable to blackmail if eventually elected as the President of Nigeria.
He said that Tinubu as the President of Nigeria will be vulnerable to both governments and organized crimes, adding that the Presidential candidate may not even pass a drug test. To Reno Omokri, these are serious issues Bola Tinubu must respond to.
To prove that his accusation on Tinubu’s involvement in a Heroin drug case in the United States is true, he dared him to take him to court if he was not involved in the case as he has accused.
He said that Nigeria cannot afford to have a “drug lord” as her President. In addition to taking him to court, he challenged Tinubu to also take a drug test with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).


Is Reno Omokri’s claim against Bola Tinubu true?
