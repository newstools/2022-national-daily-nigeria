So far, there are two lists, comprising serving governors, a former one, a UN chief, former presidential aide, and ministers, as far as speculations go.
It is not the governors alone dictating to the APC and its candidate now; the Aso Rock cabal, too, have their own list; and all of them are different from Tinubu’s choice—former Gov. Kashim Shettima.
There are reports the CPC faction of the ruling party are pushing Justice Minister Abubakar Malami and Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika.
One of the cabal, too, according to a report by the Daily Trust, has drawn up a list for Tinubu.
The report said former SGF Babagana Kingibe has forwarded three names to Tinubu for consideration.
On his list are Borno Gov. Babagana Umara Zulum, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina J. Mohammed and a liaison officer to the National Assembly, Kashim Ibrahim-Imam.
The meeting continued on Tuesday as the governors, led by their colleague from Kebbi, Atiku Bagudu, met Buhari again on Tuesday.
The debate has been about religion, following the initial concession of the slot to the north.
Some in the party believe a Muslim-Muslim ticket will ruin the APC chances while others believe competence, not religon, matters.
