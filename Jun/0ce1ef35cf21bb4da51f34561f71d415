Former Kogi lawmaker, Dino Melaye, has indicated his support for troubled Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice.
The Ekweremadus were on Thursday remanded after appearing before a UK court on charges of bringing a child to the UK for organ harvesting.
Melaye posted a viral letter that Ekweremadu reportedly sent to the UK High Commission on the visa application of the intended donor for his daughter, Sonia.
Stating his support for the former Deputy Senate President, Melaye said, “Sen. Ike Ekweremadu notified the British authorities on his trip with the said boy. I stand with Ike.”
