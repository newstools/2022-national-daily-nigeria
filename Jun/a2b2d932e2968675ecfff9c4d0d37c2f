The former senator representing Kaduna central and a well-known author, Senator Shehu Sani has just taken to his verified Twitter page to plead with the federal government of Nigeria concerning the railway in his region.
Senator Shehu Sani tweeted that “The President should reappoint Amaechi back to Transportation ministry to finish up his promised Railway projects so that we are not left with scraps of uncompleted Rail lines and vague contractual agreements with China.”
Honorable Rotimi Amaechi was the former minister of transportation in Nigeria and according to Senator Shehu Sani, he said Rotimi Amaechi promised some railway projects which he was unable to complete before the end of his appointment.
However, Shehu Sani has taken it upon himself to advise the president to re-appoint Rotimi Amaechi so he can finish the project he started in the country.
Recall that, Rotimi Amaechi also contested for the presidential seat through the All progressive Congress party but he lost to Asiwaju during the primaries.
