Popular TVC Journalist Babajide Kolade Otitujo has replied to Sheikh Gumi after he openly said that Fulanis are peaceful people and the attack on Owo should have been avoided if they were not pushed to the wall. According to Sheikh Gumi, he sympathizes with the family of the victims, but if Fulanis are given what rightfully belongs to them such killings will be avoided.
He said that no one knows where they would be heading next and if care is not taken or an agreement with these people is not reached they may begin another attack that may not be palatable to the ears of anyone that hears it. According to Gumi, such attacks are not heard in the north because they are peaceful people and they allow Fulanis to carry out their cattle businesses in their place.

Otitoju noted that the killings of Owo Catholic Church members by those people who claimed to be Fulani men are politically sponsored, and the government is still relaxed because it has nothing to do with them since the killing was not done in the north. He noted that if a reprisal action is not taken people in the south would be forced to take up arms against the Fulani people.
