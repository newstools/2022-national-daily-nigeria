Anyone could have expected that, following the scheming and near-betrayal the northern power brokers, especially the Aso Rock, cabal launched, but failed to pull off in the run-up to the party’s primary last week.
The duo of Mamman Daura, President Muhammadu Buhari’s cousin, and Kingibe, the two who have the ears of the president, reportedly worked with APC chairman Abdullahi Adau to impose their candidate, Sen. President Ahmed Lawan, on the party.
The APC governors however rejected hi, and blocked the move, despite Buhari’s plea for a free hand to choose his successor.
Against all odds, Tinubu emerged winner, givng 12 other contestants, including Lawan and V.P Yemi Osinbajo, with a wide margin.
And everyone, including Kingibe, has come to accept things as they are.
“Eyin lo kan,” the former SGF said in Yoruba.
“You will move from Jagaban of Borgu to Jagaban of Nigeria; from Asiwaju of Lagos to Asiwaju of Nigeria. For all your sacrifices, for all your effort, God will reward you this time.”
