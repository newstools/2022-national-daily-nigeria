With the 2023 presidential elections getting closer, several Nigerians have taken to various social media platforms especially Twitter, to have Political debates on the various candidates. Atiku, Tinubu and Obi have been the main topics in these Political debates online. A young man recently reminded Nigerians on what Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala wrote about Mr. Obi in her book which was published years ago.
According to this man, who identifies as @codshalom77 on Twitter, the Director General of the World Trade Organization, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala wrote a book in which she explained how she advised some Nigerian leaders to save money but most refused. She stated that it was only Peter Obi and a few others who supported her.
One of the major problems Nigeria is currently having is in her economy and Nigerians are concerned about which presidential candidate actually cares about the economic crisis of the nation. Nigerians had mixed reactions after reading all that Dr. Iweala said in respect to few men like Peter Obi trying to help the economy back then.
Below is the post made by the man, reminding Nigerians on what Dr. Iweala wrote about Peter Obi in her book

A few Nigerians were of the opinion that even though Peter Obi supported Dr. Iweala’s idea of saving, those who opposed it had a reason of their own as well.
