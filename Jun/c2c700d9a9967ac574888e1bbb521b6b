Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court rejected Kanu’s application seeking to grant him bail.
Nyako in her ruling on Tuesday ruled that Kanu has not provided sufficient reasons to warrant the court to set aside its order.
She accordingly dismissed the application for being an abuse of court process.
Kanu jumped bail four years ago before he was eventually rearrested in Kenya, and shipped back to Nigeria to continue his trial.
