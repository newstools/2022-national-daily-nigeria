Former aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Mr Reno Omokri has reacted to a Revelation made by a tweeter user that once you are not with your Permanent Voters Card, you will not receive the holy communion in their parish.Reacting to the tweet on his verified Facebook Page, Reno Omokri expressed surprise at the new development and affirmed that the Pope would never approve of such decision by that Catholic parish as he revealed that the Catholic church is apolitical.

He went on to reveal that once you meet up with the 5 conditions of receiving the Holy Eucharist, then no priest can deny you that even if you don’t have the PVC. He listed the conditions as follows:
1. You must be in a state of Grace.
2. You must have been to confession since your last mortal sin.
3. You must believe in the church doctrine regarding Transubstantiation.
4. You must observe the Eucharist fast
5. You must not have been excommunicated, or otherwise censored by the Catholic Church.View pictures in App save up to 80% data.
