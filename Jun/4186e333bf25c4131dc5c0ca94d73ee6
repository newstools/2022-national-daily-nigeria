The post-convention era became gloomier after the PDP presidential candidate picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate for the 2023 general elections. These culminated into speculations that Wike may defect from the PDP; the speculations subsequently led to visits by members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), including the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, to lobby Governor Wike to join forces with them.
The PDP has also been involved in the visitations to Governor Wike to ward off invaders from other parties plotting to snatch Wike from the PDP.
The Senate Minority Leader, Philip Aduda, joined the league of visitors to Rivers State Thursday leading some senators of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to consult with Governor Wike in Port Harcourt.
Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State had earlier led a PDP delegation to Rivers State where they had a closed-door meeting with Governor Wike. Governor Mohammed and his team had met with Wike the same day Peter Obi visited.
Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State had also encroached on the Rivers State governor seeking his defection to the APC.
In the delegation of the Senate Minority Leader, Aduda,  were the Deputy Senate Minority Leader, Shuaibu Lau, Senate Minority Whip, Chukwuka Utazi; and Deputy Senate Minority Whip, Danjuma La’ah.
The delegation was received in Rivers State by Governor Wike, accompanied by Senator Barry Mpigi who represents Rivers State in the National Assembly.
The PDP delegation met with Wike at his country home in Port Harcourt behind closed doors.
