Dokubo said Wike should be the one apologizing, reminding him of how he booted out the party’s former national chairman Uche Secondus.
In a Facebook Live, Dokubo said: “I was livid with anger that Nyesom Wike will tell people that he was betrayed. Betrayed by who? The people you are abusing? The people you treated like rats?
“They should accept your aspiration so that when you reach Abuja as president, you will kill us? People don’t advise you. You have cows like Ishi Samuel Nwanosike, you made Chairman,that has elevated you to the position of a god.
“If someone should be talking about betrayal, it should be former PDP Chairman, Uche Secondus. You kicked him out because of your political aspiration, now you are talking about betrayal.”
Wike allegedly tackled Atike dollar for dollar in the primary election, and came second with over 270 votes behind Atiku;s 371.
