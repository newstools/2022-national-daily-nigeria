The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has revealed why presidential aspirants from the Southwest in the race for the All Progressive Congress APC presidential ticket could not reach a consensus.
About four aspirants from the Southwest zone were among the 13 aspirants cleared by the screening committee of the APC. They are Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi and former Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun.
These aspirants have reportedly met twice at a meeting organised by Olusegun Osoba and Bisi Akande, who are former Governors of Ogun and Osun States respectively. According to reports, part of the reasons for the meeting was to produce a consensus among the aspirants. However, efforts to reach a consensus have so far not yielded any results.
Speaking to Channels TV reporters at the Eagles Square, the venue of the ongoing APC presidential primaries, on why aspirants from the zone could not reach a consensus, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu who was part of the two meetings organised by the two former Governors, said it has not been easy for them to achieve consensus because all the aspirants believe they have the qualities to be President.
He said, up until two, three hours ago, consultations are still ongoing among the aspirants and anything can still happen at the venue of the primaries. He reiterated that conversations about consensus is still going and consultations are not over until ballot papers are distributed.
When asked who the delegates of Lagos are pledged to? He said, that is for the delegates to decide.
