If Buhari refuses to cower under threats from the “political god”, my respect for him would be in tact. Nigeria needs a younger, more vibrant and decent leader.
I thought Buhari is not reviewing his preferred candidate untill primary day Option (1) is Tinubu Option (2) is GYB this two Men are the stampede on the ground of APC. But GYB have potential to generate a Tsunami in every region.
What if the preferred candidate is Tinubu..
