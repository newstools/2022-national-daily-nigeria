“As a political party, when we have programmes such as congresses and primary elections, we are bound to have some pockets of issues across the 18 local government areas.
“One cannot say everything is good. We are not angels. In order to put our house in order and prepare ourselves for the 2023 general elections as a united family, we have to reconcile ourselves.
“We have different tendencies, ideas, opinions, so, we must bring everybody on board to work together,’’ Peretei stressed.
