No doubt the forthcoming 2023 general election has brought about a lot of elevation online and as the day passes by, the supporters of each candidate of Peter Obi, Tinubu and Atiku are doing their best to educate people in ways they can and in doing that, a Twitter user named Jennifer Thomas took to her Twitter handle in which she shared a video narrating her experience after she took it upon herself to go to the market to educate the market women.
According to her, only 4 out of 100 people knew the Labour Party logo and even though they were chanting Peter Obi, they didn’t know the party and the logo. In the video, she shared where she was seen sharing bags with an inscription of Peter Obi’s picture and said she wished she had more bags to share in other to educate them.
A woman after collecting the bag was seen shouting “Obidents” and smiling. Check out the screenshot below.
Here are some reactions that trailed the video of the lady.
One must commend the action of the lady as these are the kind of people who shouldn’t be left out, especially on how important they could turn out to be in the 2023 general election.
