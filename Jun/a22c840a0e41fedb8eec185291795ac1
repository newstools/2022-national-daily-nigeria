As expected, reactions have continued to trail Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s recent outburst against some persons in the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the alleged plot to impose a consensus presidential candidate ahead of the party’s primaries.
Recall that while addressing party delegates in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Thursday, Asiwaju claimed that he was responsible for the emergence of Muhammadu Buhari as president in 2015, insisting that it was time for him to take over the reins of power beyond 2023.
“If not for me that stood behind Buhari, he wouldn’t have become president. He even wept on national television and vowed never to contest again but I went to meet him in Kaduna and told him he would run again, I will stand by you and you will win, but you must not joke with the Yorubas and he agreed.
Since he became president, I have never got ministerial slots, I didn’t collect any contract, I have never begged for anything from him, it is the turn of the Yoruba, it is my turn,” he was quoted as saying.
No doubt, Asiwaju’s remarks have led to a flurry of reactions, with some observers absolving the president of any blame in the ongoing saga in the country’s ruling party.
Taking to his Twitter handle some hours ago, former APC presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba stated that thought Tinubu may have been betrayed, but not by Buhari.
According to him, the Jagaban of Borgue was betrayed by those who have benefitted from him politically in the past.
To buttress his point, Garba wondered why it is northern politicians that are now rallying around the former Lagos governor in his battle to clinch the APC’s presidential ticket.
