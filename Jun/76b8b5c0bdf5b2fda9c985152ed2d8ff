Social media followers were ecstatic to learn that Oga Sabinus, a gifted Nigerian online comedian, had once appeared as an extra in a four-year-old music video when he was neither rich nor famous.
As an extra for the music video of Nigerian singer Davido’s DMW hit track, Aza, featuring the label music executive himself, singer-songwriter Peruzzi, and Duncan Mighty, the skit maker, who obviously wasn’t as well-known back then as he is now, is seen in a much younger, much slimmer, and balder frame.
The skit creator revealed what transpired after he was featured in the video shoot after learning that internet users had learned about his humble past. According to him, he had to trek a great distance after the shoot, and the trek sapped his body’s excitement from being in the video.
He wrote
“The kind trek I trek after that video shoot e comot the whole video from my body”
