A chieftain of the PDP, Chief Bode George, has recalled the unexpected development at his place of worship following the attack on the Saint Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. In his interview on Arise News, Chief George said fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket would be a complete lack of respect. 

Sharing his ordeal, Chief Bode George said, “You are asking for the trust of the same people that you are trying to govern.” A public office is a public trust. There is currently a high level of unnecessary tension on a religious basis. All sorts of information are flying through the media, and people are now more conscious. Nigeria is a secular state. An example is my experience in church on Sunday morning.
He continued, “I got to the cathedral and the usual gate of entry into the church was locked. I kept looking around to see what was happening. Apparently, they had stationed security personnel around, and we all had to go through the main door by the side. This had never happened. However, the attack on Owo and some other places has given people that kind of alert to be careful. Is that what we have turned places of worship into in Nigeria? You should be free in churches and mosques as they are God’s houses.
People are now more careful because of the killings in such places. That parameter has been woven into this country’s political equation. However, if you do not have to bother about that, it means you have no respect or regard for those practicing one religion or the other. If you think they do not care, it means you do not care about the people. It will be a measure of your quality as a person. The will of your people should be of more concern. Leadership is about the betterment of the people, not about personal ambition.
