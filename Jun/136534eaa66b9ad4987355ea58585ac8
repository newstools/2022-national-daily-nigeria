Elder statesman, Professor Ango Abdullahi is of the opinion that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo could have been the best candidate to fix Nigeria but the political system in the country would not allow him.
According to the convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidates, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar are the right individuals to fix the nation.
He said: “We still haven’t got the man who we think will fix Nigeria. What we have on the ground is not good enough. How can you look at Tinubu and Atiku to say they are the ones who will fix this country?”
“They have been on the ground for the last 25, 30 years and so on. What have they done? What are we looking for?”
“I believe we have not had a good array of politicians. With due respect to some of them that one saw contesting, I am not being selfish here by referring to certain people like Prof. Osinbajo.”
“He is a quality material but the political system will not tolerated” he added.
