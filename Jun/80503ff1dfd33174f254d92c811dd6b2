It was learnt that the headless body was discovered by his relatives two weeks after his abduction. His decapitated body was later found between the boundary of Uke and Ukpor.
A family source said the deceased was quickly buried by the family on Tuesday as his body was already decomposing.
“We couldn’t believe he would be killed after they paid the N15 million ransom requested by his abductors, despite his physically challenged condition,” the source said.
Police spokesperson, Tochukwu Ikenga confirmed the incident, saying an investigation was ongoing to ensure the culprits were arrested and prosecuted.
According to him: “The victim was abducted around 10:15 pm in his house on 9th of June and efforts were made to rescue him before this unfortunate development. His body was found between the boundary of Uke and Ukpor.
“We are still not relenting on our investigation as we will ensure that the culprits will face the law.”
