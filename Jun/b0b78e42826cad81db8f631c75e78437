Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State had ordered the relocation of Deputy Governor Rauf Aderemi Olaniyan from his formal office to the Ministry of Environment after the deputy governor’s defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
Deputy Governor Rauf Olaniyan, who is under threat of impeachment has complied with the directive and resumed at his new office in the Environment Ministry.
The Deputy Governor noting his compliance with the directive, emphasized that he has always submitted himself to obedience, which he said, has always been his virtue. He maintained he is comfortable with the new office.
“I have had the opportunity to work with this government for 28 years. Go and ask about me from those who know me. I have never been served a query for disobedience. So, why should this be an exception,” Olaniyan said.
Deputy Governor Olaniyan played down the insinuations that he was being witch-hunted by Governor Makinde since he defected from the PDP to the APC.
The Oyo State House of Assembly had served the Deputy Governor a petition from the state lawmakers, raising accusations of gross misconduct, impropriety which could lead to his impeachment.
