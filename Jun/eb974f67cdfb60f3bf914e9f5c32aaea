Senator Shehu Sani took to his Twitter page to react to the recent frenzy on social media about the education of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

Tinubu have been widely criticized as of recent because he reportedly told INEC that he doesn’t have primary and secondary school certificates. A lot of Nigerians took to social media to demand publicly issue a statement to clarify his education status, as they were skeptical about the fact that he said he attended Chicago State University.
The Chicago State University have finally put the argument to rest, after they revealed that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was a student at their institution. A lot of journalist have since then came out to tell the public that the Chicago State University have been clarifying the issue of Tinubu’s certificate for a while now, as they constantly revealed that he was a student at he institution.

Senator Shehu Sani made a post saying that the Chicago issue was raised and settled nearly two decades ago, in reference to the fact that the issue was recently raised again. According to Senator Shehu Sani, the point is that the controversy about Tinubu’s certificate happened before the social media era.
He stated that we now live in a new age. The inquisitive new generation, attitudinally doubts & discredit historical events in the pre information technology era. See his post below.
