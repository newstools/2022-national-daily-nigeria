The former governor of Borno said the APC must not give the presidential primary ticket to Lawan.
Shettima, in an interview on channels television on Friday, said Lawan is not a recognisable brand name in the nation when it comes to politics. He earlier said V.P Yemi Osinbajo is a nice man, and “nice men sell ice cream and popcorn”.
He also claimed that if the Senate President’s name is mentioned in Ohafia, Abia state, people in the area will think he is “a tomato dealer”.
“Tinubu is the best option for us, we don’t have any choice,” he said.
