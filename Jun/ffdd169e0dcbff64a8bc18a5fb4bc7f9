Senior Advocate of Nigeria and human rights activists, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa has revealed that Sunday’s attack at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo state might have been perpetrated due to Akeredolu’s stance on issues like restructuring, resource control, power rotation, open grazing and state police.
Dozens of Christians were hacked to death on Sunday at the St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa Street.
“Owo being the hometown of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, I pray that this dastardly act has nothing to do with his principled stand on national issues.”

He urged Akeredolu “not to relent in any of these noble pursuits, if that is the genuine desire of the people that he represents”.
The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) noted that it is ungodly to take any life, whatever the motive may be.
He said whether in the mosque or church, innocent worshippers should not be killed in the course of the practice of their faith.
Adegboruwa added that although no one has claimed responsibility, security agencies bear a duty to unravel the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
“The bloodshed in the land is too much and no reason can be advanced for this desperate act of wickedness.
The SAN reminded Nigerians that the Ondo helmsman has also been at the forefront of regional security outfit, Amotekun.
The renowned lawyer expressed condolences to the families of the dead, the Catholic Church, and the people and government of Ondo.
