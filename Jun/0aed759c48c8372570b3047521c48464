The clergyman and two others were kidnapped recently along the Enugu Port Harcourt road, and were herded into captivity before they negotiated their release.
During a press briefing in Lagos on Tuesday, the cleric said the kidnappers revealed themselves as Fulani, and showed him decomposing bodies of some past victims.
According to him, the kidnappers Buhari has disappointed them.
“They even said that if they get Buhari, they will chew him to pieces because he had disappointed them,” the prelate narrated during a presser on Tuesday.
“We were taken into the bush and we trekked up to 15 kilometres. Eventually at 11 pm, they said we should negotiate and each of us should pay N50m, making N150m”.
The men later pegged the ransom at N100m.
It was the  leaders of the church and his wife to raise the money by all means to secure his release.
