President Muhammadu Buhari has taken a final decision on the region his successor would come from.
The president after a meeting with aspirants of the All Progressives Congress on Saturday, said presidency should be zone to south.
With this, Ahmad Lawan, Yahaya Bello and those eyeing the presidential stool from the north are to withdraw.
Buhari, however, said he would not anoint any aspirant, saying all of them should go and test their popularity.
