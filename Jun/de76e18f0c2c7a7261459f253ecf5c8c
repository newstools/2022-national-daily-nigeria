He said this on Monday as he swore in Justice Olukayode Ariwoola as acting CJN.
Buhari also conferred the second highest national honour Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger on Tanko. This is a customary honour for past CJNs.
Speaking on Tanko, the retired general said, “CJN Tanko dealt firmly with the issue of reckless and indiscriminate grant of ex-parte Orders that was assuming serious dimensions. History will be kind to [him] for his modest contributions to Nigeria’s Judiciary, the strengthening of our democracy.”
