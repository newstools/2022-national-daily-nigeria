Eyewitnesses have revealed how terrorists, suspected to be bandits attacked the St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State on Sunday which led to the death of over forty worshipers.
An eyewitness, Kehinde Ogunkorode, said the gunmen were about five in number and that they were shooting sporadically inside the church
“It was like a movie, they invaded the church and shot indiscriminately. Several people were killed including children and women. It was when they wanted to abduct the priest that they threw dynamite into the church,” he added.
A source who craved anonymity said “some gunmen invaded the church during service, opened fire and killed no fewer than 25 members of the church.
“The congregants were caught unaware by the killers. They also used explosives but many were shot.”
Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the heinous killing.
The President, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said only fiends from the nether region could have conceived and carried out such dastardly act, adding that eternal sorrow awaits them both on earth here, and ultimately in the hereafter.
President Buhari mourns the dead, condoles with their families, the Catholic Church, and the Government of Ondo State, charging emergency agencies to swing into action, and bring succor to the wounded.
“No matter what, this country shall never give in to evil and wicked people, and darkness will never overcome light. Nigeria will eventually win,” the President says.
