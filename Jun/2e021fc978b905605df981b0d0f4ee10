Shehu Sani, a former senator of the Kaduna central senatorial district has reacted to the latest reports of Bola Tinubu’s claim, that without him President Muhammadu Buhari wouldn’t have won the presidential election in 2015.

Tinubu made this revelation at the presidential lodge in Abeokuta, while addressing the APC delegates in the state ahead of the party’s primaries. He also revealed that he was responsible for the emergence of Professor Yemi Osinbajo as President Buhari’s Vice President and Dapo Abiodun as the Governor of Ogun state.

Shehu Sani while reacting to Tinubu’s statement, wrote on Twitter, “Actually Jagaban has played a leading role in the emergence and victory of PMB in 2015, but politics doesn’t always respect or appreciate history”.
In the above tweet Shehu Sani referred to Tinubu as Jagaban and admitted that Bola Tinubu actually played a major role, in ensuring that Muhammadu Buhari emerged as the flagbearer of the All Progressive Congress and consequently won the presidential election in 2015.
