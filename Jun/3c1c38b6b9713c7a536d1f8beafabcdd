Some of us have heard of sexually transmitted diseases, and we believe they can only be spread through copulation with someone of the opposite gender.
This is why some of us use protective devices to protect our genitals during copulation. However, according to Healthline, there are other ways people can contract sexually transmitted diseases without having intercourse.
Some activities people engage in that don’t involve copulation just to stimulate their organs can be very dangerous. This may depend on where the infection is located in the person’s body.
This information will help you to be extra careful so that you don’t become a victim of a sexually transmitted infection.
Anything you do with someone else that has to do with you being exposed to, swallowing, or having an equal exchange of body fluids can make you have a sexually transmitted infection.
The following are different ways people can contract sexually transmitted diseases without copulation:
1. People can be infected through their lips. If you kiss or use your tongue or lips to touch the fluids on the external reproductive organs of someone infected, it can be transmitted to you.
2. If you use your lips or tongue to stimulate someone’s genitalia, you will be infected with sexually transmitted infections, especially gonorrhea. One of the symptoms is that the person will have a sore throat.
3. If you use your mouth to stimulate someone’s nipples and the fluid or milk in that person’s breast is already infected, you will have a sexually transmitted disease.
4. If you intentionally or mistakenly have direct physical contact with the menstrual blood of an infected woman, either by touching or by any means, you will be infected as well.
5. If you use your hands or fingers to stimulate someone’s genitalia or anus, you will be infected if the person already has sexually transmitted diseases.
