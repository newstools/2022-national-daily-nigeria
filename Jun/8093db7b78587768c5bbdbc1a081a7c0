President of Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide Apostle Johnson Suleman has denied tweeting about the crash of the marriage of actress Funke Akindele and rapper Abdulrasheed Bello, better known as JJC Skillz.
JJC Skillz broke the internet on Thursday morning when he announced his separation from Funke, adding that she asked him to leave their house.
The filmmaker said in an Instagram post that they have finally agreed to go their separate ways after six years of marriage.
Shortly after the announcement, Suleman tweeted, “Stop disturbing us with break-up stories..When they bought you shawarma, did you give us?”
The cleric, however, tweeted again saying the tweet was made randomly.
He said, “Someone just called my attention to the ‘break up’ tweet..It has nothing to do with anyone pls…I tweet random tweets,parables, jokes and comments PRAYERS.
“It must have been a coincidence. It’s a sin to mock people. Disregard any insinuations..it was a joke and nothing else!”

Suleman is not new to controversy. For several years, he has been facing allegations of sexual involvement with a US-based singer Stephanie Otobo.
