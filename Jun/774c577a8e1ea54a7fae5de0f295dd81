The fans at the Emirates stadium have been left with exciting feelings as Napoli hitman Victor Osimhen actions suggest that he is willing to embrace the move to Arsenal.
National Daily learnt that the 23-year-old former Lille striker has admitted to the uncertainty of his future at Diego Armando Maradona club while holding that ‘anything can happen’ following the suggestion that Arsenal have submitted a £51million bid for the Nigerian.
Osimhen has just spent two seasons in Naples after the Serie A giants Napoli won the race for his signature from Lille in 2020.
The Napoli top striker who struck 18 times in his 32 appearances in all competitions last term for his club has replicated his form for the Blues into displays with his country, with the forward scoring four as Nigeria beat Sao Tome and Principe 10 – 0 in AFCON qualification match this week.
Reports in Italy claim Arsenal have placed a £51m bid for the Nigerian, though Napoli have rejected it as they value him at closer to £85m
‘I always go out on the pitch to do my best both with the national team and with my club,’ said Osimhen.
‘I don’t know my future, I know anything can happen, but now I just want to go on holiday with my family, clear my head and recharge my batteries.
‘Then we’ll take care of everything else.’
Arsenal’s interest in Osimhen stems from their frustration over a move for Manchester City ace Gabriel Jesus with Chelsea and Real Madrid believed to have thrown themselves into the midst.
The Brazilian had been touted to be MIkel Arteta’s priority target to replace Alexandre Lacazette, who joined Lyon earlier this month.
