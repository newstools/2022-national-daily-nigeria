APC presidential aspirant Bola Tinubu has continued rubbing it in the noses of those he expects to pay back in his favor but look elsewhere, the latest being Ogun Gov Dapo Abiodun.
Abiodun was there when Tinubu et Ogun’s delegates, and he took time to recall how he supported Abiodun when former Gov Ibikunle Amosun wanted to pull a fast one on aspirant Abiodun then.
“This one sitting behind me here, could he have become governor without me?” Tinubu said.
“We were at the stadium, they tore all his posters. Even the party flag, they didn’t want to hand it over to him; I was the one who brought it.
“If he wants to meet God at the right place, he must know that without God and me, he would not have become Governor.”
But the governor responded on Friday, saying he’s not an emperor.
“I am holding this position in trust for all the people of this state, and I have vowed to be fair, just, and equitable and this is the solemn agreement I made between the Almighty God and myself,” he tweeted.
Abiodun is supporting Tinubu’s rival and e-godson VP Yemi Osinbajo.
