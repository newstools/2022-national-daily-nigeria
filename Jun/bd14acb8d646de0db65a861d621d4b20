According to a report, a Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Sule Lamido has revealed two reasons why the the presidential aspirant and National Leader of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmed Bola Tinubu would not emerged as the winner of the APC presidential primary election.
1. Lamido alleged that due to the psychology and mentality of President Muhammadu Buhari, there was no way he would endorsed or support Tinubu’s political ambition to become the next president of Nigeria. He said the president would not backed the former governor of Lagos State to emerged as presidential candidate of the ruling party ahead of the APC presidential primary election.
He said he know President Buhari personally, and vowed that there is no way the president is going to support Tinubu’s candidacy, because the whole thing is going to take personal dimension.
2. He said Tinubu’s kinsmen, members of the Pan-Yoruba Socio-Political Organization, Afenifere and the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors were against Tinubu emerging as the APC presidential candidate because of his domineering nature. He said they perceived Tinubu to be a dictator and they were not willing to backed his candidacy.
He noted that the National Leader of APC is swimming alone, and he’s surprised that his beneficiaries and political actors he helped are now saying no to him. He said if there would ever be a Southern presidency, the only formidable candidate to challenged and gave the PDP and Atiku a fight for their money is Tinubu, because he has goodwill and a political family.
