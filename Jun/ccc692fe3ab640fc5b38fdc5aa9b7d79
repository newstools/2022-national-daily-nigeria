The state government, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Ibrahim Dosara, said:” the government has henceforth, directed individuals to prepare and obtain guns to defend themselves against the bandits.

“Government has directed the state Commissioner of police to issue licence to all those who qualify and are wishing to obtain such guns to defend themselves.

“Government is ready to facilitate for people, especially our farmers, to secure basic weapons for defending themselves.

“Government has already concluded arrangements to distribute 500 forms to each of the 19 Emirates in the state for those willing to obtain guns to defend themselves,” Dosara said.

He explained that the government directive followed the increase in the activities of bandits in various parts of the state.

The commissioner, however, noted the state government’s commitment to ensure adequate security and protection of lives and property of citizens, particularly during the rainy season.

Dosara said government had resolved to deal with the recent escalating attacks, kidnapping and the criminal levies being enforced on innocent communities.

“This act of terrorism has been a source of worry and concern to the people and government of the state.


“Therefore, in order to deal decisively with the situation, government has no option than to  take these measures,” Dosara said.

According to him, residents must however, apply from the Commissioner of Police, licence to own guns and such other basic weapons to be used in defending themselves.

“A secretariat or centre will be established for the collection of intelligence on the activities of informants.

” Residents are strictly warned and advised to make sure that any information or intelligence about an informant must be true and nothing but the truth.

“All information on such informants must carry correct data on the suspects, including their pictures, correct names, address, occupation and witness to testify on the facts of the information given.

” Government will take punitive measures against any one found as informant.

” Any person who give wrong information against anybody, will be served the same punishment with an  informant and will be treated as such,” the commissioner aaid.


He said government had requested the State House of Assembly to pass, as matter of urgency, the informants bill before it, to enable government to take the drastic measures on informants as contained in the bill.
