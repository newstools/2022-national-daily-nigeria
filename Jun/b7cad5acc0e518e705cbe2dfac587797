National Daily can confirm that the agent of Manchester United top transfer target Frenkie de Jong is set to jet into Barcelona for emergency talks over the midfielder’s transfer to Old Trafford.
The 25-year-old Dutchman has remain a priority target for Erik ten Hag, who worked with the Netherlands international until his £73million move to Barcelona from Ajax in 2019.
De Jong’s preference is to remain at the Camp Nou but the club are in a desperate financial position and must sell before they can sign targets such as Angel di Maria or Robert Lewandowski.
They are therefore willing to cash in on de Jong and Mundo Deportivo say the Dutchman’s agent is flying into Barcelona to hold talks with the club.
Barcelona are expected to inform Ali Dursun that De Jong is available for transfer and that they want a fee of around £70m.
De Jong has made it clear that Barcelona are his ‘dream’ club and that he wants to remain at the Camp Nou.
He is, however, willing to move if it’s clear that he will not be handed a deeper role in Xavi’s midfield.
Midfield is a priority area to strengthen for Ten Hag following the departures of Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba.
That leaves United short in the middle of the park and Andreas Pereira could be given a chance to impress after being sent out on loan to Flamengo.
