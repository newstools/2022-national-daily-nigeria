President Muhammadu Buhari has demanded the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) to declare the Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), a terrorist organisation. The president in a media interaction noted that such action would help the Nigerian government under his leadership to stem the tide violence and insecurity in southeast Nigeria.
President Buhari acknowledged the renewed trust between Nigeria and West, led by the US and UK. He cited the acquisition of fighter jets from the US, and assistance in intelligence from the UK, which he said have helped Nigeria in combating the Boko Haram terrorists in northeast Nigeria.
He solicited more foreign support as his administration is on countdown to the exit of the APC government in 2023.
