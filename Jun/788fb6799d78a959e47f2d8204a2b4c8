Ali made the statement in Abuja during a courtesy visit to the Chairman, NDLEA, retired Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa.
This is contained in statement by the Director Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Mr Femi Babafemi.
According to Ali, “my decision to support NDLEA is in the interest of socio-economic development of the country”.
The legal icon said his commitment was also borne out of his appreciation of the good works Marwa, his officers and men were doing for the country.
He said this was based on his conviction that overcoming Nigeria’s drug scourge was key to solving the security challenges facing the nation.
He commended Marwa for recalibrating NDLEA and making it an effective frontline agency.
Ali also expressed readiness to support the agency either at personal or official levels to ensure the drug war was given priority it deserved by his professional colleagues.
In his response, Marwa thanked him for the visit, saying that whatever had been achieved in NDLEA was largely due to the support and commitment of the officers and men of the agency.
He said that the agency would hold further talks with the legal practitioner on areas of assistance, especially in the prosecution of some high profile cases in courts.
The NDLEA boss, however, used the opportunity to decorate the SAN as a War Against Drug Abuse, (WADA) Special Ambassador.
