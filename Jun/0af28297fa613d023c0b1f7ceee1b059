The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEV) on Saturday faced relative disappointment in the use of technology for accreditation of voters in the governorship election in certain areas of Ekiti State. It was gathered that the Biometric Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) could not capture over 40 elderly persons at 001 unit, Ikoro-Ekiti. The voters were said to have registered in 2010. The unit has over 760 registered voters.
INEC officials were said to have attributed the failure of the BVAs to aging facial changes over the years.
