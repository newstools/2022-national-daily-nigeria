In a report published by the Russian Ministry of Defense,  85 Nigerians arrived in Ukraine after a global call was made by Ukraine for assistance. While 38 have been killed so far, 35 have returned to Nigeria.
The report said 12 are still fighting to defend Ukraine.
“Against the backdrop of the Kiev regime’s mounting military failures and massive daily losses in manpower and equipment, the flow of foreign mercenaries to Ukraine has not only decreased, but is actually turning in the opposite direction,” Russian Defense Ministry stated.
“Despite the Kiev regime’s efforts and increased payments, the process of mercenaries leaving to the ‘other world’ or back to their countries of residence has not been stopped by the Kiev leadership”, the statement added.
