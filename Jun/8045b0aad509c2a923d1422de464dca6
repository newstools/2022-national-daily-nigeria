Machina said he was approached by some people to step down but that he wouldn’t.
In a letter signed by Machina to the National Chairman on Monday, the senatorial candidate said, “I write to reaffirm my continual aspiration as the All Progressives Congress unequivocal senatorial candidate for one North Senatorial district, following my clearance, participation and victory at the party primaries where I pulled 289 votes out of the 300 total votes cast”.
“I write to reaffirm that I remain committed to the mandate which I won at the primaries, and I have not in any form or manner communicated otherwise. I have been informed of a purported malicious and mischievous report and insinuation to the contrary”.
The Senate President contested the APC presidential ticket and lost. He had been representing Yobe North senatorial district at the National Assembly for 15 years.
