Addressing journalists at the National Assembly on Wednesday, Orji Kalu asked the Christians to consider who rules the family of the APC presidential candidate  Bola Tinubu.
According to him,  the wife of  the APC flagbearer is a pastor.
“Let me tell you, in my house, my wife is the head of the house in reality,” he told newsman at the NASS complex in Abuja on Wednesday.
“Even you men that are here, now that your wives aren’t here, they are the head. Like if I wear this clothe, my wife will tell me ‘My dear, this clothe is not good remove it’.
“The Christians should relax because Tinubu’s wife is a pastor and ones she’s a pastor we are protected because she’s not a house wife. She has political knowledge,” he said.
Remi was ordained in the RCCG in 2018.
The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has rejected the idea and warned parties against it.
Some APC stakeholders also took a position against such possibility.
But Tinubu has insisted nobody, no institution,  can force any decision on him.
