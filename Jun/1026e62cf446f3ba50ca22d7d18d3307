Former governor of Ekiti state, Ayo Fayose has kicked against the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar, demanding that a southerner must succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
Fayose is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Atiku Abubakar — a northerner — is the presidential candidate of the party.
The former Ekiti governor was one of the presidential hopefuls who contested the primary of the opposition party.
In a tweet posted on Wednesday, Fayose said it is the turn of the southern region to produce a president.

“The PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness,” he wrote.
“The current President of Nigeria is a 2-term Northern Presidency, thus implying that it MUST be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or NOTHING.”
Writing in Yoruba language, Fayose also tweeted that “awa south lo kan” — which means “it is the turn of the south”. The remark is a reference to the catchphrase attributed to Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The former governor added that Nigerians should “await details soon”.
At the PDP presidential primary, Fayose was unable to secure the mandate of the 16 Ekiti delegates — and as such, he secured no vote.
