The former governors of Akwa Ibom, Ogun State, Godswill Akpabio, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Baduru Abubakar of Jigawa state and former Speaker of House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole have stepped down for the former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, a major contender in the party’s presidential race.
This was confirmed by Nationaldaily at the on-going APC’s special convention and primary on Tuesday.
According to them, they took the decision not because they are weak but to promote the sportsmanship spirit of the Northern governors, who had agreed that the next President of the nation should come from the Southern part of the nation.
