Hannah Salihu had been offering her service without any hassle until one of the friends came for a session which, by Hannah’s rate, went for N1000.
According to sources, problem started when the man paid and left, and the lady found out her N5000 was gone.
She ran after the customer, and an argument began.
This led to the other two joining them for a search of the room where they found Hannah’s Quran.
Their holy anger boiled over, and they lynched the sex worker who one of them just slept with for a fee.
But they didn’t stop at that, they burned the corpse of the lady who also came from the north where the three mallams come from.
Police Public Relations, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the incident, and the prosecution of the three.
