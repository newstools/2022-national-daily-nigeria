His decision to dump his party presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar for the southern agenda might not be unconnected with the bad blood between his ally and Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike and the PDP.
Wike lost the ticket and the V.P. slot too, and he has been stewing as he gathers sympathies from the likes of Benue Gov Sam Ortom and Fayose who have rejected Atiku.
There is also the possibility Fayose is angry with Atiku and te PDP who didn’t support the PDP guber candidate for the Ekiti election the APC won.
On Wednesday, Fayose said it is the turn of the southern region to produce a president, and added the reigning slogan the APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu just made hip.
“The PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness.
“The current President of Nigeria is a 2-term Northern Presidency, thus implying that it MUST be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or NOTHING,” he said in a tweet.
“Awa ‘South’ lo kan’.”
Tinubu, in the run-up to the APC primary, took a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari and the schemers around the Villa for trying to edge him out of the contest despite helping Buhari win the 2015 presidential election.
Tinubu’s one-liner in Yoruba—Emi lo kan—has since become a buzz.
While it may be too hasty to conclude Fayose is defecting to the APC, he has not hidden his respect for Tinubu as a politician and Yoruba leader.
