This feat at the Grand Stage Agadir in Morocco has earned him kudos from Super Eagles fans on social media, with many comparing him to the late legend, Rashidi Yekini.
A tweep, Temitope said, “Victor Osimhen edging closer to equal Rashidi Yekini goals record in the Super Eagles.  Yekini 37 goals Victor Osimhen 28 goals. Just 9 goals away from equaling Yekini’s record. Mind you, Osimhen is just 23 years old.”
Tuka said, “Victor Osimhen is now the fastest player to reach 14 goals for the Super Eagles, surpassing Rashidi Yekini.”
Dami Adenuga tweeted, “Victor Osimhen might surpass Rashidi Yekini’s goal record for the Super Eagles.”
Another tweep said, “I’m more glad that Victor Osimhen scored 4 goals and Ademola Lookman scored his first goal for the Super Eagles, too. Thing is, with the way things are going, it looks like Victor Osimhen will break the age long Rashidi Yekini’s 37 goals record faster than expected.”
