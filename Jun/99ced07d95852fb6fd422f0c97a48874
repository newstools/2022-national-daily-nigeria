Reno Omokri, a die-hard supporter of Atiku Abubakar of the All Progressives Congress has challenged the die-hard supporters of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to mention just one thing the Presidential candidate did in Lagos State.
When you ask Bola Tinubu’s supporters why they are rooting for him ahead of the forthcoming Presidential election, they would claim that Tinubu was one of the best Governors Lagos State has ever had. Some claim that it was Tinubu who built Lagos State and made it what it is today.
But Reno Omokri believes that Tinubu who previously served as the Governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007 and Senator for Lagos West during the brief Third Republic did no tangible thing for Lagosians.
In a tweet, Reno Omokri called out Tinubu’s supporters in a challenge to mention one single thing the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress did in Lagos State as a Governor.
In his defense, Reno Omokri said that the new roads that are seen in Lagos State were built by fashola. He also said that during Fashola’s administration, Lagos State was clean, although, the cleanliness is now gone.
He also pointed out that the internal security the state enjoyed, which is long gone was under Fashola’s administration.
Considering the above claims, Reno Omokri said that Tinubu did nothing in Lagos State as a Governor, adding that he should campaign on Fashola as an achievement.
If you know history very well, can you counter Reno Omokri’s claim that Tinubu did not do anything for Lagosians when he was a Governor by mentioning the things he did?
