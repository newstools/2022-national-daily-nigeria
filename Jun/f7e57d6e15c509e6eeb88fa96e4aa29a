Popular author and human rights activist, Reno Omokri, has taken to social media to commend the former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for paying a condolence visit to the Governor of Ondo State, Akeredolu.
The tragic incident that happened on Sunday recorded the deaths of over 50 people in the state. Governor Akeredolu, on getting to the scene of the incident, shed tears. However, the APC Presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, recently visited the state to sympathise with the governor.
As regards this, Reno commended the effort of Tinubu, pointing out that he displayed a true leadership quality. Speaking through his official Twitter handle, he said, “I commend Bola Tinubu for speedily visiting the scene of the Owo killings at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo. This shows leadership. Right now, the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, needs finances and blood donations. I know that Asiwaju has the means, and I encourage him to donate! ”
 Reno also noted that Tinubu should not only visit but contribute financially to the situation. What is your opinion concerning this?
