Former Minister of Aviation and All Progressives Congress chieftain, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the viral video of Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom.
In a recent interview with Arise Television, Samuel Ortom claimed that Atiku’s camp and the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party should have gone to see Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and appeal to him instead of calling him on phone.
He noted that Nyesom Wike is the pillar of the party and that he is the one who brought him to the Peoples Democratic Party in 2015.
Reacting to the development, Femi Fani-Kayode stated on his verified Facebook page that ‘there is fire on the mountain’.

Atiku Abubakar defeated Nyesom Wike in the PDP presidential election which was held some weeks ago. Many people had thought that Atiku will pick the Governor of Rivers State as his running mate but rather, he picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State.
