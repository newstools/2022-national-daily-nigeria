APC presidential also-ran Tunde Bakare has praised himself after flunking out of the primary with nothing.
The pastor had boasted he sent just sms to the over 2,300 delegates and with that expected he would defeat 21 others scrambling for the party’s ticket.
While addressing delegates before the election, Bakara claimed he carried favor and was not stepping down like other did for party leader Bola Tinubu who won the contest.
In a statement on Thursday, Bakare was quoted saying he spoke the truth in the midst of wolves.
“I am happy that I have passed the test of character by not paying any delegate.
“I passed the test of courage, by speaking the truth in the midst of wolves and the test of conviction by standing true to my beliefs. Those who will make a difference must be different.”
Bakare was among aspirants who spent N100 million to buy the nomination form.
