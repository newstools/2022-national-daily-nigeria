A human rights lawyer and activist, Barrister Malcolm Omirhobo has once again caused a stir at the Federal High Court on Monday when he appeared amidst his co-counsel in traditional religious wear.
Okay.ng recalls that Omirhobo had dressed in a similar fashion to the Supreme Court, Abuja last week.
His deviant action was a subject of many debates. Some opined that it was a wrong move while others have backed him.
The lawyer had claim to be protesting against the recent ruling of the apex court permitting Muslim students in Lagos schools to wear hijab with their uniform.
Fellow legal practitioners present in the Court were amused as he took his seat waiting for the day’s proceedings to commence.
