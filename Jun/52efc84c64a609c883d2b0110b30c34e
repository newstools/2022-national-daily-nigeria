Engineer Joe Igbokwe was on his Facebook account to shower praises on Dr Chris Ngige for the record he set when he was the governor of Anambra state, recall that Chris Ngige was the governor of Anambra state from May 2003 to March 2006 under the PDP’s platform, he was eventually succeeded by Peter Obi.
In his Facebook post, Joe Igbokwe praised Dr Chris Ngige by saying, the former governor of Anambra state who is now the minister of Labour started a road revolution in Anambra state because he knows the meaning of road infrastructure. Joe Igbokwe then opined that till today no governor has surpassed the track records of Chris Ngige in Anambra state, Joe Igbokwe went further to ask people to quote the statement he just made concerning Dr Chris Ngige.
I don’t know why Joe Igbokwe is bringing up this matter now but i know that a lot of Peter Obi’s supporters might disagree with his opinion because some of them believe that Peter Obi is the best governor Anambra state has produced so far.
