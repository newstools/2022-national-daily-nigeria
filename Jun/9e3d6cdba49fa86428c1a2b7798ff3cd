The party paid the tribute in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Agbo Major, in Abuja on Sunday.
Major saluted Nigerians on the occasion of the occasion of 2022 Democracy Day.
He said that Nigeria was irrevocably placed on the path of democratic governance after years of military dictatorship, civil war and political upheavals that threatened the nation’s corporate existence.
He, however, said that the 2022 Democracy Day called for sober reflection, prayers and collective action to terminate social injustice.
He said that it also called for collective efforts to end marginalisation, terrorism, insurgency, militancy, kidnapping, hunger, unemployment, poor infrastructure and resolution of issues that led to the elongated ASUU strike.
He, however, said that the forthcoming general election provided citizens an opportunity to take their corporate destiny into their hands and massive vote for a new, better, greater and prosperous Nigeria, which he said NNPP symbolised.
“It is time for action. All eligible voters should quickly go and register and obtain their permanent voter cards, ensure they vote and their votes count in the overall result as power belongs to the people.
“This is the only way to restore the nation’s unity, greatness, prosperity and dignity in the comity of nations.
“We are all in it together to usher in a New Nigeria citizens will be proud of,” Major said.
