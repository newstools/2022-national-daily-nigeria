Todd Boehly took over as the sporting director for the club this summer after Marina Granovskaia left her position.
What this means is simple – Boehly will be in charge for the transfer negotiations this summer during his first summer as the club’s owner. He also took over as the chairman of the club following Bruce Buck’s departure.
While Chelsea fans were frustrated with the slow movement on the transfer front, it has now been reported that Leeds United star Raphinha is close to signing for the club and it was Boehly who negotiated the deal, jumping ahead of Arsenal and Barcelona to get the attacker.
Fans have shown their appreciation for the new owner on Twitter:
BlueFooty: “Boehly will get Chelsea moving swiftly like Bayern in the transfer market. I told you it would rain hard this week. Trust the process…”
Lampard_lawal: “Todd Boehly just woke up this morning and decided to sign Raphinha.. That’s the real boss move, welcome to the new era!!’
aj_jayakar: “I need to apologise for my impatience, Todd Boehly has mad game. Stealing Raphina from Arsenal, close to signing Sterling, linked with De Ligt and Neymar…scary hours for the Premier League.”
