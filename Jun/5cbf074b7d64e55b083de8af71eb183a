The Nigerian musician and composer Charles Chukwuemeka Oputa, best known by his stage name Charly Boy, recently stirred up controversy online by sharing a throwback photo of APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu.
An official account he controls tweeted that Tinubu’s old handle was “Bobo Chicago.”
Fans of the 72-year-old musician responded “yes” when asked if they recognized the man in the photo as Bola Tinubu.
Do you recall him? In the photo’s caption, he posed a question. His former nickname was “Bobo Chicago.” It’s unclear who he is.
Previously, Tinubu had lived in Chicago for a few years. The People’s Gazette states that Tinubu told INEC that he earned a business administration degree from Chicago State University in 1979. During the military regime of the 1960s, he allegedly claimed that a secret club took his degrees.
Concerns about Tinubu’s age and credentials have been at the forefront of conversations since he was selected as the APC candidate in the party’s presidential primary election a few weeks ago.
Yesterday, the ex-governor of Lagos State boarded a plane for Paris. His media assistant told Daily Post that he flew to Paris for important meetings and will be back in the country in a few days. Although the trip’s announcement was met with a variety of reactions on social media.
