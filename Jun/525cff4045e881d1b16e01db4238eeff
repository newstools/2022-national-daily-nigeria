Ondo Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has characterized the attackers of the Owo Catholic church.
According to him, those carrying out attacks such as the one on St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in the state, are foreigners from Mali trained in Libya.
While describing the attack as vile and satanic, Akeredolu promised that the perpetrators would be arrested soon.
Gunmen had on Sunday morning attacked the church and opened fire on worshippers with many killed.
“What happened here is too tragic. It is the most tragic event. What is happening in America is a child’s play to what has happened here,” he said in his continued reaction to the attack.
“To say the least, it is condemnable. I’m grieved. Let me let you know that we have a duty to protect you.
“Security services also lost about two men. The attack was sudden. How they carried out the attack and entered the church cannot be explained.
“No one thought that such incident could happen in Ondo State not to talk of people.
“Let us not retaliate because we will apprehend them. Don’t take laws into your hands. I want to express my condolences to the families of the victims.
“Security agencies in the state must take all steps necessary because this must not repeat itself.
“On our own part, we must be vigilant. We take responsibility for what has happened.
“Most of those that are carrying out this attacks are foreigners from Mali who were trained in Libya,” he said.
