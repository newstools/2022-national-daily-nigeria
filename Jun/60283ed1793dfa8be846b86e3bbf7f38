Former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, expressed his opinion on the reason why Bola Ahmed Tinubu claimed he did not attend primary and secondary school. He alleged that the presidential candidate does not want Nigerians to know his real age.
The PDP member expressed his thoughts on social media, where he wrote that the presidential candidate of the ruling APC doesn’t want Nigerians to learn about his real name and age, that is why he claimed not to have attended primary and secondary school.
Reno made the allegation through a message on twitter, and his tweet reads; “The only reason Tinubu is now claiming that he did not attend any primary or secondary school is because if he comes clean about his early education, it will expose other lies he has told Nigerians about his true age and name. Tinubu, what is your real name and age?”
Omokri accused Tinubu of hiding his real name and age from Nigerians.
