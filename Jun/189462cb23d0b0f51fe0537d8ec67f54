His wife Success Oduwa reported to the police that their 20-month-old son was missing—still missing after Gabriel directed her to travel from their base at Ibeh, Edo, and go get the baby from his sister in Warri.
According to Delta Commissioner of Police Mohammed Ali, Gabriel lied to his wife, and it was the discovery that made the police team at the Warri B Division move in, and arrest the father.
After that, the puzzles just unravelled.
“Upon interrogation, suspect confessed to have murdered the said child at Ewabogun Bush by Catholic Road, Benin city using hand saw to cut off the head and buried it by a palm tree in the bush and threw away the headless body of the child,” a statement by police said.
“The suspect also stated that he actually killed the child, because of a dream he had, where he saw a man who told him that if he kills the child and use the child’s blood to rub his head, he will become rich.”
Gabriel is in custody now as investigation continues.
