A well known Nigerian politician and former Senior Special Adviser to the governor of Edo State on News Media, Jack Obinyan has taken to his official Facebook page to slam the current governor of Cross Rivers State, Banedict Bengioushuye Ayade assured the former governor of Lagos State, national leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, and Presidential candidate for APC, Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu that Cross Rivers will deliver 100% votes during the 2023 Presidential election.
According to information gathered from a reliable source, the current governor of Cross Rivers State, Banedict Bengioushuye Ayade, while addressing the press at the Margaret Ekpo International Airport, Calabar made it known that his state will ensure the victory of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC standard-bearer, Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 Presidential election, and will deliver 100 per cent votes for him.
This particular statement made by Ben Ayade seems not to go down well with Jack Obinyan, as he took to his official Facebook page to slam him.
While sharing on his official Facebook page, Jack Obinyan made it known that Ben Ayade will lose his polling until to the Obidients (the movement for Peter Obi), adding that he (Ben Ayade) is ignorant of the trend.
Further speaking, Jack Obinyan said Ben Ayade should put a call across to governor Obaseki in order for him to be updated on what is happening.
