Popular convener and human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has taken to social media to reply to a supporter who stated that Peter Obi has the whole South East and South South. When he saw this, Deji Adeyanju took to Twitter to dismiss the statement, claiming that it would make winning in his home state of Anambra even more difficult.
According to what the supporter tweeted, “Peter has the whole South East and South South.” Peter will share the northern votes with Atiku, Tinubu, and Kwankwaso, then Peter will get many votes in Lagos. Peter is surely winning this election. I’m not predicting. I’m not a prophet, but this shall happen. “Deji, who couldn’t help but share his opinion, noted that Peter Obi can’t win any state in the South South. He noted that people would remember that he said this.
Speaking through his official Twitter handle, he said, “He can’t win any state in the South and you will remember this tweet. The only state outside Anambra he would have been able to win is Abia, but Alex Oti is too weak. The political gladiators there will swallow him. Even in Anambra, it will be a huge struggle. “See reactions from Twitter users below;
