The picture of a Nigerian lawyer dressed in supposed Igbo traditional attire to take part in a hearing in court, began trending online. In fact, in his interview, the Nigerian lawyer averred that since the Supreme Court upheld the ruling which restored the use of hijab by female Muslim students in Lagos, then he had the right to dress in his choice attire to court proceedings.
Meanwhile, following the many reactions to the pictures and words of the Nigerian lawyer, Zara Onyinye described the Nigerian lawyer as a ‘confirm bigot’ (a person who is against another on the basis of their membership of a particular group). In a series of posts on her official Facebook account, the APC media personnel and staunch supporter of the present government in Nigeria, revealed that the lawyer was the same person, who had sued the federal government some years ago because of the Arabic inscription on the Naira.
According to Zara, the lawyers charade was very unnecessary because the Supreme Court’s ruling never forced the hijab dressing mode on anyone. She reacted thus:
‘This guy is just a confirm bigot. Just got to know that he was the same person who sued FG for the Arabic inscription on the Naira”.
