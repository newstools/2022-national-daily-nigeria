Nigerian activist, Reno Omokri, has taken to social media to condemn the move made by a Nigerian Reverend Father against his members without permanent voters cards, as he denied them entry into the church for service today.
A video which is currently trending on social media platforms shows the moment a Nigerian Reverend Father denied his church members without their permanent voters cards, entry into his church, as he stated that the church of God cannot be filled with people who cannot participate fully in the election processes of Nigeria.
The Reverend Father further stated that it is time for Christians to start participating in the elections of the country, as he tried to stop his church members without their permanent voters cards from attending the church service.
And so, following such move made by the priest, Nigerian activist, Reno Omokri, took to his official Instagram page to react, as he stated that the church is supposed to welcome everybody, irrespective of whether they have their permanent voters cards or not.
Reno Omokri finally stated that the Catholic Church is a universal body of Christ, and is not supposed to carry out such move.
