Obi bailed out of the PDP when he felt his presidential aspiration threatened.
His new party, the LP, however gave him its ticket for the asking.
But Ekweremadu in an interview circulating on social media said the LP will waste the southeast vote though he admitted Obi is a credible candidate.
“I can assure you that the South East will vote for PDP. We ask ourselves if Obi wins the election and the answer is no.
“Can the aast afford to throw away our votes and be sentimental about a matter that concerns our people, our children and future? No.
“We don’t intend to do a thing that we will regret in the future but we believe that Obi is qualified.”
The former Anambra governor seems the arrowhead of the push by Ohaneze and other cultural groups who believe the southeast ought to get into power for fairness’ sake.
