Former spokesperson and Chieftain of the All Progressive Congress Party APC Lagos branch Agbalanze Nnewi best known as Joe Igbokwe took to his official Facebook page to react after Reno Omokri apologized for using Tinubu’s health against him.
According to Mr. Reno, who uploaded a throwback photo of Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar alongside others however noted that he has been feeling a sense of guilt inside him for making a caricature of his well-being.
Speaking further, the activist who seems to be a strong critic of the All Progressive Congress Party APC presidential ambition made it known that he has realized that if one does not leave this earth young, one might suffer ill health.
In conclusion, he affirmed that he is deeply sorry, and on that grounds, he is rendering a heartfelt apology to Asiwaju for his actions towards him as he makes a promise never to do that again, noting that he will rather focus on issues that matter as he asks God to bless everyone.
The elder statesman who seems touched by his apology could not say many words as he could only note that Reno Omokri has simply displayed a sense of maturity as he says that he is gently coming back home.
Guys, what is your opinion on this?
