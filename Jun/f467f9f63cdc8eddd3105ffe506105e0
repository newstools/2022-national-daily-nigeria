Many top Nigerians seem not to be happy that Peter Obi left the country to Egypt instead of going to Ekiti State just like Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar did, and looking at their point of view, one can tell that they are not far from the truth. Peter Obi should be in Ekiti State making plans for the election instead of going to Egypt to study their system.
What is your view on this?.
