Following the announcement of Nigerian politician, Alhaji Kabir Ibrahim Masari, as the Vice President of 2023 presidential flag bearer of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of the forthcoming general elections, I have decided to unveil five among the many things Nigerians must know about the politician.
Recall that the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) party, Abdullahi Adamu, had earlier on, announced APC chieftain, Alhaji Kabir Ibrahim Masari, as the running mate of the party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
However, there are speculations that the politician may be dropped by the party in the future, as they had to submit his name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to beat the deadline that was set for the different political parties to submit the names of their 2023 presidential and vice presidential candidates before tomorrow.
And so, following such announcement by the party chairman, I have decided to present five among the many things that Nigerians should know about Kabir Ibrahim Masari, and they include;
1. Alhaji Kabir Ibrahim Masari hails from Kastina state, and is a relative of Kastina state governor, Aminu Masari.
2. Masari was once the National Welfare Secretary of the APC when Adams Oshiomole was the National Chairman of the party.
3. The politician was a chieftain of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the former party of Muhammadu Buhari.
4. Kabir Masari was also a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), during the tenure of late Musa Yar’Adua, but dumped the party for CPC, after the demise of the former president.
5. Kabir Masari also participated in an election that dethroned a ruling party by a previously powerful party, a victory that was recorded in the country’s history.
