Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the popular Nigerian Columnist and Professor of Journalism, Farooq Kperogi has revealed reasons why the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) are not ready to governed after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.


He said that only the major opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has shown more preparedness and readiness to governed Nigeria more than any other political parties in the country, at the national level. He said compared to the ruling party, the PDP has shown they were coherent, earnest, transparent and predictable. Considering how they conducted their party national convention as scheduled and how they’ve submitted the name of its vice presidential candidate to INEC on deadline, with little or no internal rancor.
While the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) had to extend the date of their party national convention and the party presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu could not submitted the name of its vice presidential candidate to INEC on deadline and instead submitted a placeholder, which was a vexing political anomaly Nigeria hadn’t witnessed before and smaller political parties has sadly quickly copied, with the likes of the Labor Party (LP) and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) doing the same thing.
He noted that the activities of the ruling party, APC, over the last few weeks has depicted a party not ready to governed Nigeria, because of the party indecisiveness and also considering the facts how the party removed the names of candidate who won the party primary elections and replaced them with the names of party honchos who didn’t participated in the party primaries. He further added that the ruling party, APC have been burdened with a double whammy of indecision and no intentions ahead of the 2023 general elections.
