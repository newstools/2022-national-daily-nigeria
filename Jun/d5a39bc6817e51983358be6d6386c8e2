The uproar caused by the reported adoption of Senate President, Ahmed Lawan as the consensus candidate of the party is gaining momentum among political analysts across Nigeria. A Nigerian-born Professor of Journalism who is based in the US, Farooq Kperogi recently took to his Facebook page to share with Nigerians what will happen to the ruling party if truly the party adopted Lawan as his candidate. Farooq Kperogi said,
“Several newspapers, including Tinubu’s The Nation, have reported APC chairman Abdullahi Adamu as saying that Senate President Ahmed Lawan is APC’s consensus candidate! If this decision holds, APC would officially be a dead party. The 2023 election would be between PDP’s Atiku Abubakar and Labor Party’s Peter Obi, who were ironically on the same ticket in 2019!”
The analysis proposed by the erudite professor might not be right because, with the support of other presidential aspirants in the party, Ahmed Lawan might win the 2023 general elections. The stumbling block is now how the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress will get to convince other presidential aspirants to step down for Ahmed Lawan.
All the top aspirants have gone a long way in becoming the flagbearer of the party. It would only be by the grace of God for political juggernauts like Tinubu, Osinbajo, and Amaechi to withdraw from the race for Ahmed Lawan, but if they do and support him, Ahmed Lawan has a good chance of being becoming Nigeria’s next president.
