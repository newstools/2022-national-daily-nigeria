Three candidates are already penciled down, and the yardsticks didn’t include the last primary, thus shutting out his closest rival Nyesom Wike.
Since Wike has declared he can’t be a second-class citizen in his country, Atiku has chosen three candidates—two from the south-south and one from the southeast.
According to a report by the Daily Post, Atiku has selected Akwa Ibom’s Gov. Emmanuel Udom a presidential aspirant, his Delta counterpart Ifeanyi Okowa, and ex-Imo Governor Emeka Ihedioha.
Although things are not cast in iron yet, the lot ay fall on Ihedioha, a former Speaker who took over from Aminu Tambuwal when he left the House of Reps.
Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku in the last primary.
“Ihedioha is very qualified to occupy any position in the land. He has built capacity, loyalty and competence around himself.
“He has also shown that he is a worthy friend. But for now, most of the things you hear are speculations. The right decisions will be taken at the right time”, a PDP chieftain told the news portal.
