The founder, Ogoni Group, otherwise known as the Ogoni Libration Initiatives (OLI), Dr. Douglas Deeka Fabeke has emerged the Rivers South-East Senatorial Candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for the 2023 general election.
Fabeke who emerged as the sole aspirant in the senatorial primary held in Bori, Khana Local Government Area was also returned unopposed.
Speaking during his acceptance speech, Fabeke commended delegates and the Party for maintaining law and order during the election.
He lauded the 7 LGAs that made up his senatorial district promising not to fail the trust bestowed on him.
“If elected, I will not just make laws but will also be committed in the development of my constituents”, he said.
He continued: “I promise to prioritise Education, Healthcare, Industrialization, Security and human capacity development.
“I will ensure that our people are empowered with jobs, skills, good infrastructures, education and healthcare. We have gone around the senatorial districts and we have identified a lot of things to be fixed and done in different ways”, he said.
Fabeke said he will host a town hall meeting where he would present his blueprint and make it available for everyone.
“I will print my blueprint and make sure that everyone has access to it because I want people to hold me accountable if I go contrary to my promise”, he said.
Responding, The Labour Party Chairman in Rivers State, Abiye Pepple while handing the Party’s flag to Fabeke said the party is convinced that Fabeke will defeat his opponents in the other parties considering his track records.
Pepple revealed that few party members who had planned to pick the Rivers South-East Senatorial forms dropped their ambitions because they believe that Fabeke is the most qualified person.
