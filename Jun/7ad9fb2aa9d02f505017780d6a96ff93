Famous Nigerian singer, Samklef has got netizens reacting as he shares a video that shows the moment an illegal practice was being held during an election.
In the video, a group of Hausa-speaking men (believed to be northerners) could be seen tampering with the ballot papers as they insert them into a ballot box.
Along the line, they were joined by some kids, the young men handling the ballot box instructed them to insert their fingerprints and they carry on with the voting process.
Samklef shared the video on his Instagram page, pointing to the voters as ‘offline supporters.’
