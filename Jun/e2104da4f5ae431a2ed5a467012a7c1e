The Catholic priest and Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry, Reverend Father Ejike Mbaka, on Monday dissociated himself from the protest by his followers Sunday at the Adoration venue.
Mbaka in a statement in Enugu on Monday, denied knowledge of the protest, saying he did not approve the action. He disclosed his obedience to the closure of the Adoration ministry by the Enugu Catholic Diocese Bishop till further notice.
Mbaka, in the statement declared: “My attention has been drawn to activities that took place in the Adoration ground on Sunday. I am not in any way involved in such activity.
“We received with obedience the directive issued by my Bishop, His Excellency, Most Rev CVV Onaga on June 17, 2022
“May I, therefore, appeal to the faithful, in particular members of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Nigeria, to remain calm and united with the body of Christ in the Diocese and also refrain from any measure of violence either in action or by abusive utterances.
“Those who take to attacking or insulting my dear Bishop should desist from such.
“The Bishop is the Shepherd of the Church in the Diocese and we remain his flock who in every way and at all times is expected to be respectful, obedient, and willing to respond favourably to his apostolic directives.
“May I also remind you that all Adoration activities have been suspended till further notice. Adoration Ministry is ever submissive to the mother Church. I enjoin all adorers to know this and remain constantly in prayers for the manifestation of the will of God in the life of the Ministry.”
Bishop Callistus Onaga of Enugu Catholic Diocese had suspended activities at the Adoration Ministry, after Mbaka insulted Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party, saying Obi is a stingy man and should not be Nigeria’s president.
