The Idi-Araba violence is the continuation of the friction between the riders and the state following a ban on the transport system in Lagos.
Lagos government banned motorcycle operations in some locations since June 1, 2022.
The affected Local Government Areas are Apapa, Eti Osa, Ikeja, Lagos Island, Surulere and Lagos Mainland.
The authorities already seized thousands of bikes which are now routinely crushed publicly.
Reacting to today’s face-off, Lagos Police Command has assured residents of safety.
And Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, denied reports that the riders fought security personnel.
“The Taskforce went well prepared. They (riders) were just causing a scene after Taskforce left with some of their impounded motorcycles.”
Hundeyin said the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and men from the Area Command have been drafted to the scene.
