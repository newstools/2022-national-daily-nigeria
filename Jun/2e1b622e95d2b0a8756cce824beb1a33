He said this Sunday at the Men of Valour conference themed “Navigating the corridors of power, the church, and the politics” organised by the Revival House of International Church (RHOGIC), Abuja.
“We can’t allow this gangsterism to continue, Nigerians should take back their country. 70 percent of those who are in politics today should not have any reason to be there. I have said it, politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum.
“This is the only country where the worst is leading. I was a trader and gradually entered into politics. When you take far more than you need, you are sick.
“How do you explain that one person took N80 billion, it is not greed, it is sickness. When you take one billion that is greed but when you take N80 billion that is sickness. Mad people have taken over our politics. If we get young people with the competence and capacity to be there, things will change.”
A suspended account-general was uncovered along with multibillion naira pilfering.
He added that praying for Nigeria alone cannot do much in fixing the country.
“We have prayed enough, it is time to act. With these people in power? You can pray from now until anytime, they won’t go until you chase them out. So, it is time to act, not just pray. It is time for us to close the church and deal with these people.”
Obi also urged the youths not to make a profession out of politics.
