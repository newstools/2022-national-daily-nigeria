The growth of a baby’s body as well as their mind requires that they get enough sleep. In addition, it is also important to be aware of the degree of danger posed by their resting posture, as certain sleeping positions for infants can put them at risk of asphyxia. A report that was published on healthline will serve as the basis for my discussion of the potential risks associated with putting babies to sleep on their stomachs.
1. This position has been shown to increase the risk of injury for babies in a number of studies. It may be difficult to breathe and cause the airway to become constricted as a result of the pressure that builds up on the jaws. It also prevents a sufficient amount of oxygen from reaching the baby’s lungs and the cells of its body, which leads to problems with cellular metabolism. It has the potential to make breathing difficult and perhaps lead to asphyxia.
2. it is dangerous to lay babies down to sleep on their stomachs since this position can raise the likelihood of the condition known as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is possible for someone to pass away for no apparent reason, and it is even possible for a healthy infant to pass away.
