Alex was stabbed to death two years ago in London.
Marking the anniversary of his death, Khafi, who works with the Metropolitan Police said, “Today marked two years since my brother Alex was murdered in cold blood on the streets of London. It feels so wrong to commemorate this kind of anniversary; wedding anniversaries, birthdays etc are things that should be celebrated and remembered, not a day of death.
“But two years on and still his murderers have not been found. This is NOT OKAY. It hurts me every day and is not getting any easier, I just find better ways to suppress my grief as time goes on, but every time it arises it is like a dagger to my chest afresh. It has made me so sensitive to any news of death, especially shootings like those in Owo, Uvalde, and particularly news of young black boys dying needlessly. They trigger so much for me.
“So I was dreading today. And if I had it my way I would have buried my head in the sand and pretended this isn’t my reality. I had 3 brothers and now I only have 2. And the people responsible are still walking the streets. It makes me so so angry.”
