Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma has said the fuss over the certificates of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is needless.
Recall that controversies have continued to trail the educational qualifications of Tinubu since he won the presidential primary of the ruling party.
While preparing to contest the primary, the APC screening panel was asked to disqualify him over “questionable educational qualifications”.
However, speaking with journalists after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa on Tuesday, Uzodimma said the former Lagos governor has run for office in the past and won.

The governor said there is no need for him to resubmit his credentials to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because he did that when he ran for office.
“For my presidential candidate, the issue of certificates shouldn’t even arise,” he said.
“In 1999, he contested elections and became the governor of Lagos, in 2003 he contested election as second-term governor of Lagos. He ran and won as a senator in the country. Where record-keeping is efficient, and the INEC server is functional, he doesn’t need to do a fresh submission.
“However, if whatever he is supposed to submit is not handy, it is not late yet. I’m sure before the time he will submit whatever is required of him.”
