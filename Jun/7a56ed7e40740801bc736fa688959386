Or had all of the southwest aspirants stepped down for their national leader Bola Tinubu, Nigerians would not have known many of them are no-accounts.
But the crowded presidential primary race had exposed the empty barrels and the blowhards in the ruling party, and others who are jokers.
One thing however characterizes the groups: losses.
Or wastefulness, in another word.
Ogbonnaya Onu, Ahmed Yerima, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Ikeobasi Mokelu, Jack Rich, Sen. Rochas Okorocha, Pastor Tunde Bakare spent over N500m to get  nine votes.
And the loss goes beyond that lump sum gifted the party. Bakare, for instance, lost his shine and clairvoyant credibility after polling zero in an election he claimed was  divinely arranged to make him president just within weeks of buying the form, and holding a Zoom talk shop with Nigerians who are  no delegates living abroad.
The loss also reveals the comeuppance delegates give aspirants who laze about and insult them. Bakare got no delegates because he said he only sent sms to the delegates. And while he was shooting off his text messages, winner Bola Tinubu spent months and years, according Babachir Lawal  engaging with the delegates across the nation.
Okorocha, Mokelu, Rich,  Sani, and Nwajiuba didn’t even send any sms. Because they thought themselves special,   they were hoping Buhari will ram them down the delegates’ throats.
No surprise their zeros were resounding.
