Senate President Ahmad Lawan disclosed this after a closed-door session of the chamber on Wednesday.
Lawan said a delegation of the chamber, put together by the Senate committee on Foreign Affairs,  would on or before Friday this week visit Ekweremadu and his wife in London.
He said that the lawmakers were briefed about Ekweremadu’s travail during the closed session, stating the role the Nigerian High Commissioner to United Kingdom, Ambassador Sarafadeen Ishola, has been playing to ensure that Ekweremadu gets all needed assistance.
He commended the High Commissioner and his team for the work they are doing in providing needed consular support for Ekweremadu.
“The High Commission has been providing all Consular Services including the engagement of lawyers to defend Ekweremadu,” Lawan said.
He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been engaged and is currently providing diplomatic support to Ekweremadu.
He assured Ekweremadu’s family that the Senate would work to get all needed support for Ekweremadu and his wife to overcome the present challenge.
“Because the issue is already in court, there a limit to which we can say on the matter. We assure the family we will continue to do our best to support him,” he said.
Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice were last week arrested and arraigned at Oxbridge Magistrates Court in London.
The court ruled that the couple be remanded in custody till July 7, 2022, which is the next adjournment date.
