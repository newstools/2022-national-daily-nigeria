Daddy Freeze, a well known Nigerian social commentator went live on Facebook to share his opinions concerning the Ike Ekweremadu’s organ harvesting case.

Daddy Freeze said, “I am sure 90% of Nigerians might sell their Kidneys for 10,000 pounds. I am saying this with a consideration of how things are economically for many Nigerians presently.” According Google, 10,000 pounds to Naira is presently a bit over five million naira.Furthermore, Daddy Freeze is of the opinion that “the case of Ike Ekweremadu ended like an indecent proposal.” He explained saying, “I think the donor of the kidney decided to change his mind after they got to the hospital outside Nigeria. I personally do not believe that the donor was tricked like some people alleged. He only played smart by claiming he is underage when he got there.”
Daddy Freeze said people should all know human trafficking is an illegal act. In his words, “if you need a kidney, get a kidney legally to avoid problems.”
