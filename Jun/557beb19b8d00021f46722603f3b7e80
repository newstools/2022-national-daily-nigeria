The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has revealed the Twitter user who raised the alarm of her kidnap and 16 others in Abuja June 14 is now having her mind analysed for the motivation.
In her tweet that day, Ameerah claimed she and other 16 victims, including three pregnant women and two children, were kidnapped at gunpoint in the nation’s capital by men in police uniforms.
The reaction across the country was not unexpected.
But a few days later, the FCT command said the Tweep was found, saying there was no kidnapping incident as alleged by Ameerah.
She has been arrested for raising false alarm.
“She is in police custody, currently undergoing medical examinations. While investigation continues please,” the FCT police command spokesman said.
