She stressed that she has no idea who the girl in the video was. On the other hand she bashed people who are spreading the false rumors, for not using their brains to analyze the video well, to see that it was not her.
Kelly’s most popular video to date, with 4.8 million views, is one in which she sets men on fire.
Her first TikTok video, which has received over 2 million views, was in November 2021, when she wore a black shirt that exposed her belly button, waist beads, and bending low.
Kelly’s dance style and clothing style have been replicated by many online, and her fan base is growing on a daily basis.
