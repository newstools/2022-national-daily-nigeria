Both were charged Thursday with conspiracy to facilitate the travel of a 15-year-old Lagos street boy for organ harvesting.
But Ekweremadu through his lawyer, Gavin Irwin, told the court that at no stage did he arrange transport for anyone with intention to exploit them.
“There is no question this is a serious allegation. Mr Ekweremadu is a member of the senate in Nigeria. He has previously held an even more senior role as deputy president of the senate,” the Daily mail quoted hm as sayig.
“He is a member of the bar in Nigeria. He is a principal in a law firm that bears his name.
“Those issues taken together go way beyond him being a person of good character…rather that he has led a blameless life as a public servant.”
Antonia Gray, who represented Mrs Ekweremadu, said her client has never been complicit or involved in any alleged illegal trafficking of any young person.
“She is a financial accountant with an unblemished record.’
The prosecutor made an application to adjourn matters for 14 days.
The case was adjourned to 7 July 2022.
