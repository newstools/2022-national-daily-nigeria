Three days after Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle directed the State Police Commissioner to issue licences to residents to acquire guns to defend themselves against bandits, over 30 communities in the state have been attacked and sacked by the terrorists.
News of the invasion was made known on Tuesday by the lawmaker representing Gummi/Bukkuyum Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Suleiman Abubakar Gumi, while moving a motion on the need for the military to send more troops to the affected areas in the state to quell the rising bandits’ attacks.
According to Gumi, the heavily armed bandits simultaneously attacked several communities, killed 16 people, injured many others, rustled cattle, and destroyed property, set police stations, farmlands and food silos ablaze.
