A Good Samaritan on Wednesday persuaded a distraught man from committing suicide at the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge in Lagos.
A video showing the moment the man was rescued was shared online by the official Twitter handler of the Lekki Concession Company.
In the video, the man is seen holding on to the railing and was ready to jump off the bridge, but was saved by some LCC Patrol officers who got to him in time.
One of the officers – a woman – is seen consoling the man and encouraging him to see the bright side of life, instead of ending it all.
Another man behind the camera is heard telling those holding the man to hold him tight so he doesn’t forcefully jump off the bridge.
The suicidal man eventually yielded to the words of encouragement and was pulled off the bridge. According to the LCC, he has been handed over to the Police.
Sharing the video, LCC wrote, “Thanks to the quick intervention of LCC Patrol Officers, a young man was saved from committing suicide on Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge. He has been handed over to the Police.”
