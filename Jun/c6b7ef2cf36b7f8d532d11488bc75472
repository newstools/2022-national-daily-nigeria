His defeat at the APC primary in spite of a standing prophecy is one.
When he first received a prophecy all the way from South Africa in 2013 that God would honor him with the vice presidency of Nigeria, he acted like a Thomas.
But it came to pass, and he headed back to Brekpan’s House of Revival Church to share the testimony of the power of prophecy.
“This prophetic gathering is very special indeed,” he told the congregation on October 10, 2015.
He then explained the theory of prophecy and divine works.
“He doesn’t look at size; he doesn’t look at anything fancy. He just does it in accordance with His grace and mercy”
And his South African seer then, Pastor Daniel Awusanya, confirmed it.
Awusanya was once an associate of Osinbajo at the RCGG in Nigeria before he founded his own ministry in South Africa.
By 2021, another prophecy issued out of Ghana’s Prophetic Hill Chapel.
Its founder Prophet Nigel Gaisie predicted during te year’s crossover service Osinbajo would step up.
“Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will become president,” BBC quoted him as saying.
Osinbajo didn’t claim the blessing publicly though. But he’s a believer.
Now that he missed the first human step to that divine upliftment failed, Gaisie has yet to react.
