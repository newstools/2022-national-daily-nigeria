Hon Mudashiru Idowu Obasa is set to draw swords with the Lagos State Governor Babajide Olushola Sanwo-Olu over the latter’s blatant attempts at foisting All Progressives Congress APC consensus candidates on constituencies across the state.
Obasa is peeved over the Governor’s foray into Alimosho State Constituencies 01 and 02, where Sanwo-Olu through the Deputy Governor Kadiri Obafemi Hamzart selected Hon Kehinde Joseph and Hon Luqmon Olatunji Orelope as the APC candidates.
This medium gathered that Obasa in line with the instruction of APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, had penciled down Hon. Ajigbotafe was the candidate for Alimosho State Constituency 01 and had indeed hoped to return Hon Kehinde Joseph in Alimosho State Constituency 02.

Sanwo-Olu in collusion with Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola alter ego in Alimosho Federal Constituency Alhaji Abdullahi Enilolobo and former Lagos State Deputy Governor HE Adejoke Orelope Adefulire connived to share power to their cronies, with the Aregbesola faction taking the House of Representatives (Ganiu Adele Ayuba) and House of Assembly Alimosho Constituency 02 (Hon Kehinde Joseph) tickets, while HE Orelope Adefulire was settled with Alimosho Constituency 01 ticket, this she made available to her younger brother (Luqmon Olatunji Orelope).
Obasa who facilitated the reconciliation of HE Adejoke Orelope Adefulire, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Sustainable Development Goals, SDG, and her faction with Asiwaju Tinubu is angry that he was neither consulted, nor his consent sought before Sanwo-Olu and Orelope Adefulire went into a power sharing agreement with the Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola led camp in the Constituency.
Obasa has vowed to ensure a review of the consensus arrangement to reflect a proper power outlook in Alimosho Federal Constituency, wherein all pro Tinubu elements are settled and the antagonistic Aregbesola camp is not rewarded for their treachery against Asiwaju Tinubu presidential agenda.
“It is sad that Sanwo-Olu is in bed with Aregbesola and his minions in Alimosho federal constituency, it is disheartening that HE Orelope Adefulire will go on a round table discussion with Abdullahi Enilolobo, who is the promoter of Senator Musiliu Obanikoro senatorial and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo presidential projects in this election window.
