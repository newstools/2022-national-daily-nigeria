APC national chairman Abdullahi Adamu is not backing down on his drive to impose Sen. President Ahmed Lawan as the party consensus candidate even after President Muhammadu has distanced himself from the arrangement.
Adamu , whom the NWC members have accused of dropping Buhari’s name to achieve his ends, earlier said the president chose Lawan.
Buhari cleared himself earlier in a meeting with the northern governors, saying, “I have not anointed anybody,” according to s statement by Garba Shehu, presidential special adviser.
After that, Adamu again convened another meeting at the party secretariat in Abuja Monday night to discuss the issue Buhari has already settled.
There are reports Lawan will still be announced as the consensus candidate as the presidential primary kicks off Tuesday.
Two of the 3 candidate screened for the election have pulled, leaving APC leader Bola Tinubu, V.P Yemi Osinbajo, Minister Rotimi Amaechi, and Lawan as main contenders.
