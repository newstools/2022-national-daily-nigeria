Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike of Rivers State has blasted those he described as desperate and wicked politicians who manipulated a video circulating on Social Media portraying the governor as being provoked to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Wike noted that the video in circulation was intended to mislead unsuspecting public, including PDP members. He told the public to ignore the manipulated video.
Governor Wike observed the PDP offered him the platform to excel in his political career, insisting that he will never under any circumstances, defect from the PDP to the cancerous All Progressives Congress (APC).
The Special Assistant Media to the Rivers State Governor, Kelvin Ebiri, in a statement, cited declared in part: “our attention been drawn to video circulating on social media purporting my intention of defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party.
“We urge the public to ignore the distorted video. Those behind it are desperately wicked and intend to mislead the public. Governor Wike remains a faithful, committed member of the PDP and will never leave it for cancerous APC.”
