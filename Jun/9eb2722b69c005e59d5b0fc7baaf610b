The News Agency of Nigeria reports most journalists, even with their accreditation tags, were not only refused entrance into the convention venue, but were tear-gassed and manhandled by security operatives.
Some of the journalists, including senior News Directors and Editors deployed to cover the convention lost their valuables in the process as the security operatives became violent.
It, however, took the intervention of Morka, who was called on phone by one of the accredited journalists to address the situation.
“I am sorry about the incident involving the use of tear gas by the police at the Foreign Affairs Ministry Access Gate of Eagle Square. Some of our accredited journalists were affected.
“As soon as I was notified, I went there and helped to give access to all accredited journalists.
“I hope everyone is settled in now at the convention,” Morka said on the the APC correspondents’ WhatsApp platform.
