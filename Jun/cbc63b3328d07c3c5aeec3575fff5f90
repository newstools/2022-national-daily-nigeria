Since Ahmad Lawan lost out in the APC Presidential election the hope of his return to the national assembly has been shaky because he has not succeeded in getting the ticket to return to the Senate, the candidate currently holding the ticket to Yobe north senatorial district made it clear that he is not ready to give the ticket to Ahmad Lawan. Babajide and his colleagues discussed the matter on their program and Babajide was asked if Bashir Machina is getting enough support to keep the ticket. Read Babajide’s response below.
“Machina’s decision to keep the senatorial ticket is getting a lot of support amongst the supporters of Bola Tinubu they think this is payback time for Ahmad Lawan, they are not happy with him because he contested against a man who is known to have supported him over the years, he supported him to become senate president but Bukola Saraki double crossed everybody and became Senate president but Asiwaju still retained his support for him, Ahmad Lawan came back in 2019 and he became the Senate president, that was why you see that even in his speech Asiwaju could not resist a dig at him because he didn’t expect that to happen.
Now with this kind of misfortune some of those supporters will be happy that it serves him right, he was playing a bad game in Abuja not knowing that in Yobe he was already toying with his political future. I hope Lawan will be able to convince Machina but it does not look like that would happen because the people behind Machina are saying no way, and they know that without a withdrawal letter from Bashir Machina that position cannot be taken”.
