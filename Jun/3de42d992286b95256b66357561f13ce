Although he missed the Senate primary, the two-term governor will get the ticket by hook or by crook from a past Commissioner for Land and Housing, Aminu Bala Bodinga who got the ticket for the senatorial seat.
Bodinga, an associate of the governor, was said to be holding the ticket for him while the presidential primary went the way it did.
Tambuwal has always hedged his bets any time he goes for the presidential primary.
He did in 2019, losing to Atiku. But the former Speaker still secured his guber ticket to contest for his second term.
When his term expires in 2023, he will be heading for the Senate where former governors retire.
