Reactions have trailed the post made by the general overseer of Omega Fire Ministries, Apostle Suleman, about the presidential flagbearer of the Labour party, Peter Obi

Some Nigerians have been campaigning and showing solidarity and support for their preferred presidential candidate for the 2023 election.
For a very long time, many people have always looked forward to having a strong third-force party in the Nigerian political terrain to wrestle power from both the APC and PDP and perhaps win the presidential election.
In light of this, some people have started supporting the former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, the 2023 flagbearer of the Labour Party, to overthrow both the APC and PDP in the forthcoming election.
However, Apostle Suleman recently took to his Twitter page and typed the name of Peter Obi without any further statement. This got reactions from many of the cleric’s followers, as some people believed that his tweet was a form of support for the former Anambra State Governor. Some people claimed the cleric’s statement was such a dream that it could never come true, while others dragged him about some of his previous alleged prophecies stating that the vice president would become the next president of Nigeria.
