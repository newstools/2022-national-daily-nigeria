Reacting, Jack Obinyan said that he is pleading that Osinbajo should use El-Rufai or Zulum as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.
According to Jack Obinyan, he said: “El-Rufai, through Zipline, begins using drones to deliver medical products to over 500 health facilities in Kaduna. I repeat, this man or Zulum should just be our running mate I beg”.
