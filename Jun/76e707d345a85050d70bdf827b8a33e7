Arsenal were reported to have made the signing of the Gabriel Jesus their priority after the Brazil international emerged as Mikel Arteta’s top transfer target for the summer window with the Arsenal manager keen to bolster his attacking options following the departures of  former captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette to Barcelona and Lyon respectively.

Jesus, meanwhile, had just one year remaining on his contract with City but was looking to leave the Premier League champions in order to secure more playing time ahead of Brazil’s World Cup campaign in Qatar later this year.
Arsenal agreed a £45m fee with City last week, while Jesus completed his medical with the Gunners this week.
And now it appears Arsenal are on the brink of unveiling their latest signing as Jesus was spotted in full kit at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday.
The 25-year-old was wearing the No.9 shirt, which was vacated by Lacazette who left the Gunners and returned to Lyon on a free transfer earlier this month.
Jesus is set to become Arsenal’s fourth signing so far this summer following the arrivals of Fabio Vieira, Marquinhos and Matt Turner.
