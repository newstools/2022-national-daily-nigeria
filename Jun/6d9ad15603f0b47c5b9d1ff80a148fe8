The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, was on air with Oseni Rufai and during the interview which lasted about an hour, a Northerner called in to ask the former Anambra governor why he has never condemned the activities of IPOB and instead atimes trying to justify their activities.
Replying to that, Peter Obi said whoever tells the person that is not saying the truth and what he has always said is that he has watched killings in the east and one cannot kill, do wrong things because of agitation, as it’s wrong and criminal, which is why he condemns it anyway and anytime.
Peter Obi went on to say agitating and killing people is unacceptable and when people talk about agitation, it’s a different thing as they can deal with it by dialogue and if, today, Peter Obi was President, he would dialogue with all agitators as it’s a democratic society, but insisted, he wouldn’t discuss with a criminal. If they kill or kidnap, would be dealt with decisively and did it when he was governor in Anambra as he dialogue with those who needed to be dialogued with and dealt with those who needed to be dealt with.
