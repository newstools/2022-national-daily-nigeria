After cussing and scathing LP.s presidential candidate PeterObi, Rev Father Ejike Mbaka has incurred the anger of Pope’s representatives in Nigeria.
Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese Calistus Onaga has imposed a ban on Mbaka’s Adoration Ministry.
The priest earlier said Obi will never be president ecase he’s a tight-wad who refuses to share money like other candidates do for the hungry and the poor in Nigeria.
This was another instance in whichMbaka would violate the limis the Catholic Church gave him after his fight over contract awards with his old favorite and President Muhammadu Buhari.
In a letter he personally signed, addressed to ‘All the Clergy, Religious and Lay Faithful in the Catholic Diocese of Enugu’, Bishop Onaga has now banned them from having anything to do with the Adoration Ministry.
“In the light of the happenings in the Catholic Adoration Ministry Chaplaincy Enugu, capable of undermining the Catholic faith and teachings and after several fraternal corrections and admonitions to Fr. Camillus Ejike Mbaka, the Chaplain of the Ministry and after having given him pastoral directives and guidelines for the Ministry Chaplaincy, which he persistently violated and in fulfilment of my pastoral duties as the Chief Shepherd with the obligation to promote and safeguard the Catholic faith and morals in Enugu Diocese, I hereby prohibit all Catholics (clergy, religious and lay faithful) henceforth from attending all religious and liturgical activities of the Catholic Adoration Ministry until the due canonical process initiated by the Diocese is concluded.
“My decision is based on the fact that some of the teachings and utterances of Fr. Camillus Ejike Mbaka at the Catholic Adoration Ministry are not consistent with the teachings and faith of the Catholic Church.”
Bishop Onaga ordered all Christian faithful to keep praying for Fr. Mbaka.
