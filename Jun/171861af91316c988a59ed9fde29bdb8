Ahead of the 2023 elections, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has taken to his Facebook handle to highlight what Nigeria needs as a prerequisite to the nation’s healing. The controversial Islamic cleric had confessed that the country is unarguably being polarized by regional, tribal and religious divides. Sheikh Gumi remarked that a popular northern president with a national appeal and a respected Vice President from the South-South region is what Nigeria needs.The cleric had traced the root of Nigeria’s economic woes to ex-President Jonathan’s defeat in the 2015 election and herdsmen revolt from their loss of livelihood. Sheikh Gumi recounted how the Niger Delta militants threatened that Nigerians can not reject their man (Jonathan) and love their oil at the same time. He explained that this is the cause of oil vandalization, the backbone as far as Nigeria’s economy is concerned.
The former military officer suggested that having the President and the Vice President from the two aforementioned regions will appease the Niger Deltans and herdsmen which is what can do the healing as of now. In the article titled “Candidates And The Healing Combination”, the famous preacher admitted that although other combinations can win the elections, they can not govern effectively with the two forces (Niger Delta militants and herdsmen) actively dragging the nation.

Sheikh Gumi remarked that although winning an election is a game of number, efficient governance is beyond numbers.
Of all the prominent presidential candidates, it seems Atiku Abubakar is the only northern candidate that has been linked with picking a running mate from the South-South region, in person of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State. Do you think Sheikh Gumi’s remarks indirectly endorse Atiku Abubakar for the 2023 presidency?
