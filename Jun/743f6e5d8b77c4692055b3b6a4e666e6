The spokesperson of the Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Joe Igbokwe, has taken to social media to relate the total number of votes scored by the former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to a Bible chapter related to the number.
Tinubu scored 1271 votes before emerging as the APC Presidential candidate. Tinubu was victorious because his applied strategy worked out for him.
As regards this, Joe Igbokwe took to his official Facebook page and wrote, “Asiwaju scored 1271 votes. Psalm 127 vs 1 reads: unless the Lord builds the house, it’s Builders labour in vain.”
According to Joe Igbokwe, the APC Presidential candidate wouldn’t have emerged as the winner if God was not on his side. He would have labored in vain if God had not been his builder.
Regardless of this, the spokesperson of the Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, is determined to support Bola Ahmed Tinubu to the end.
