Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, an investigative journalist reacted to the news of Senator Aliero defection to the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. Senator Aliero was a two time Governor of Kebbi State, and a former minister of the FCT. He is currently a senator of Kebbi state.
Babajide Otitoju while on the show stated that Senator Adamu Aliero is seen as the most powerful politician in Kebbi state. He added that it is a worrying sign when powerful politicians join the rival party, especially when the general elections are approaching and the party wants to ensure that it remains in the power at the center.

The host of the program stated that Nigerian politicians have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing and refused to learn new tricks.
Babajide said it’s everything you can blame on selfishness, the politician see politics as a zero self game and wants to appropriate everything that is available, he doesn’t want competition and wants to be the only fish in the pond.
Babajide added that Nigerian Governors are selfish lots, they want to go to the Senate after their tenure ends and at the same time, they want to produce the person that will succeed them. He said Governors ideally should pick one out of the two.
