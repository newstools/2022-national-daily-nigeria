“Ekiti people have spoken loud and clear. The outcome of the election has shown that Ekiti people are honourable people who always support and reward leaders who have served them diligently and faithfully.
“I have no doubt that the governor-elect will serve Ekiti people even more diligently, and create opportunities for other young people.
