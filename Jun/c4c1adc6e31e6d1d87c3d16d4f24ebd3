Recent report reaching National Daily can reveals that the possibility of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong set to make a switch to Old Trafford is largely because his former boss at Ajax Erikten Hag has promised him that he is poised to build his new Manchester United side around him.
United new boss Ten Hag has made  de Jong his top transfer target this summer with United close to agreeing a fee with Barcelona for the Dutchman.
National Daily can confirm from a report by Marca that United’s offer is €60million plus another €20m in add-ons which they are confident the La Liga club will accept.
Barcelona are under pressure to sell in order to alleviate some of their own financial pressures, while offloading de Jong will wipe his annual €40million salary bill off the balance sheet.
United are growing more confident of changing that however with the report adding ten Hag has told his former Ajax midfielder that ‘the whole game will revolve around him’ in Manchester.
De Jong who enjoyed an impressive showings for Netherlands in June and recently admitted he is more comfortable in the national team’s set up than the role he has at Barcelona will hope to be offered a similar role like in his national team at United which Marca believes very likely.
Following the departures of Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba, ten Hag is keen to sign two midfielders this summer.
In addition to de Jong, United are also interested in Chelsea star N’Golo Kante, with Chelsea prepared to listen to offers for the Frenchman.
United are also considering a move for PSV Eindhoven star Ibrahima Sangare, who is believed to have a release clause of around £30million.
