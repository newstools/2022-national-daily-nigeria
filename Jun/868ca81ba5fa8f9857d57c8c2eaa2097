President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the APC presidential aspirants to band up and choose one among them as the party flagbearer.
Buhari stated this when he hosted them at the presidential villa in Abuja on Saturday night.
“I wish to remind you that our choice of flag bearer must be formidable, appealing to the electorate across the board and should command such ability to unify the country and capacity to address our critical challenges,” he said.
“Ahead of the Convention, the party machinery has screened and found all aspirants eminently qualified. Recognizing this fact, the Screening Committee has, amongst others, recommended that consensus building through consultation, be intensified.
“Without prejudice to your qualifications, I urge all of you to hold consultations amongst yourselves and with the party, with a view to building a consensus in a manner that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants, bring up a formidable candidate and scale down the anxiety of party members.”
The President assured that in the interest of the nation and the party, he would continue to provide effective leadership during the transition processes and on-going consultations.
National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu had promised that all stakeholders of the party would be reached in the consultation process.
