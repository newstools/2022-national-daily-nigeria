Reactions have trailed the video of the arrested Owo Church Attackers In Ondo State by the Joint Task Force which comprises the military, police and Amotekun operatives. Watch the video here.
This video was shared by the younger brother of the former governor of Ekiti State, Isaac Fayose with the caption “Confirmed News: St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Fulani Attackers have been arrested.” Immediately after he shared the video, Nigerians reacted to it as follows.
If this video is true, then kudos to the security operatives that arrested the Attackers. This is justice and they should be served with it. Recall that the attackers killed scores of people in the church a few days ago, leaving Nigerians in sorrow and sober for the loss of life.
Had all criminals been arrested in this manner, other intending criminals would have a rethink at involving in crimes. The swift at which they were captured needs to be studied by other parts of the country most especially the North East and South East where the problem of insurgency and IPOB attacks have become rampant.
