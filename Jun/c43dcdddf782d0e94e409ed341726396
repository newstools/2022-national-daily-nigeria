And the angry loser in the APC presidential race, Ebonyi Gov. Dave Umahi, is compounding the problem.
According to Umahi, there’s no southeast agenda.
“Our agenda is the Ebonyi agenda,” he said at a swearing-in ceremony o Monday.
Ohaneze has been projecting an Igbo agenda  rooting despite the region losing out in the two major parties.
But those sympathetic with Igbo are rooting for Obi, and he’s making waves on social media.
“We will not vote for Labour Party, we will only vote for APC. Our vote is for APC and not for the Labour Party,” he said.
“We will vote for our presidential candidate in the person of Tinubu. We must strive to liberate Ebonyi State and that is our agenda.”
Umahi picked up a fight with the pan-Igbo organization days ago, accusing them of sabotaging him during the APC presidential primary where he picked up only 38 votes.
APC’s national leader Bola Tinubu and strongman of the southwest politics scored 1271 votes.
Umahi believed only Ebonyi state delegates, of all those from the southeast, voted for him.
“You (Ebonyi delegates) have made yourselves reference points of steadfastness in the country and when people are seeking trustworthy people, they will come for you.
Others could have voted for Tinubu, V.P. Yemi Osinbajo, and Senate President Ahmed Lawan backed by Sen. Chief Whip Uzor Kalu.
“I have lost total confidence in the leadership of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-cultural organization and will openly confront anyone who challenges the Ebonyi agenda,” he said.
