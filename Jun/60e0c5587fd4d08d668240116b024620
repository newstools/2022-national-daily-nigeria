Mr. James Popoola the Administrative  Secretary to Resident Electoral Commissioner, Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) has allayed the fears of eligible voters across the state, on the little hitches observed with the ongoing continuous voter registration exercise, disclosing that more deployments of registration machines will be made to various registration centres from Tuesday 14th June,2022.

The Commission Administrative Secretary further counseled many, who might have  misconstrued the development as one which may lead to disenfranchisement of residents who are within the  voting age brackets, to bury the thought as adequate provisions are being made to arrest the situation.

“The Commission want to inform and assure all residents that adequate security and machinery have been put in place to capture all eligible voters.

“Also more registration ( i.e IVED) machines has been provided in the state, which will be deployed to the 20 Local Government Areas in addition to what they already have.

“This deployment will start from Tuesday 14th June,2022. Necessary information surrounding the deployment of the machines within the state will be communicated to stakeholders and leadership of various interest groups.

The Commission however, enjoins all eligible citizens to remain calm and also encouraged to make their way to the nearest INEC registration centres closest to them.

It also pledged to conduct a hitch-free exercise for all Nigerians.

“The Commission will continue to ensure a seamless and stress-free procedure for all Nigerians who wish to participate in the electoral process.”
