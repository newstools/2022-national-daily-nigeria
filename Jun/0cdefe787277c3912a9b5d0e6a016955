Delta North Senatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party and former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko, has shared his thoughts about former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi’s participation in the forthcoming presidential election as a candidate on the platform of the Labour Party of Nigeria.
The Delta-born politician further averred that though Peter Obi is popular and might have a support base, he doesn’t have the structure to function as he would need the majority in either house of reps or senate, state house of assemblies, and government.
He also said that all of these might take at least 8 years to be achieved, stating further that there are many things that would work against the emergence of Peter Obi as President of Nigeria and “it would never happen”.

Nwoko also said that Ndigbo are not ready for the presidency as that would have shown during the primaries. He also wondered why delegates never supported Igbo candidates but went for candidates from other regions.
According to him, Igbos are largely selfish and do not think about others, and, I do not subscribe to zoning, but believe in merit.
Ned Nwoko acknowledged the fact that Peter Obi is was not like other Governors he has met in the past as he’s quite frugal and a big-time capitalist, stating in an interview with the BBC Igbo, where he opined that he would prefer Peter Obi to come back to the Peoples Democratic Party as he will do well as a Minister of Economy and will also help the economy bounce back.
