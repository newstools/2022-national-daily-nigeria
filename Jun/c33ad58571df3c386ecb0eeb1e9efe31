Killer herdsmen intensified their hostilities on a wider scale in Benue State, taking the war to the local government area of Governor Samuel Ortom, killing 15 persons.
Governor Ortom was said to have chided President Muhammadu Buhari for failure to guarantee security of lives and property across the country. The governor had decried that whatever achievements the Buhari administration may have made had been overwhelmed by the perennial insecurity in the country.
Governor Samuel Ortom in a media interaction in Makurdi  after the State Executive Council meeting, acknowledged the killings in his local government area, lamenting that there have been enough of the gruesome killings and high rate of insecurity not just in his State but across the country.
The Benue governor had repeatedly emphasized the need for people to protect themselves, insisting that the federal government has failed to provide security for Nigerians.
