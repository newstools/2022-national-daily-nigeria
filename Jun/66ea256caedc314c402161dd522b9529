National Daily reports that a Professor of Journalism and Emerging Media at Kennesaw State University, Farooq Kperogi, has said that both Bola Tinubu, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria’s Vice President, are not youthful.
This online news platform understands that Kperogi made this comment in a social media post after Oyegun’s committee submitted its screening report to the APC’s National Working Committee on Friday, June 3, 2022.

National Daily had reported earlier that after the submission, Oyegun had hinted that youthful aspirants made the list of cleared APC Presidential aspirants.
Reacting to Oyegun’s statement on the disqualification of 10 APC Presidential Aspirants
in a post titled, ‘Tinubu and Osinbajo disqualified from APC Primaries?’ on the micro-blogging site, Twitter, Kperogi wrote: “John Oyegun, who chaired APC’s screening committee, told newsmen a while ago that only 13 “youthful aspirants” were cleared to run for the party’s primaries.

“I can bet my bottom dollar that Bola Tinubu has been disqualified. 70 years isn’t, by any system of measurement, “youthful.”
“At 65, which is just five years younger than Tinubu, Yemi Osinbajo isn’t “youthful,” either.
“The implosion of APC has just officially started!”
