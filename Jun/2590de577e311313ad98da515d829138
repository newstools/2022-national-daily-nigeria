Peter Okoye Nigerian hip up singer, popularly known own as Mrp, has reacted to the attack following the trending video online where some Igbo traders are attacked at some places in Lagos. There were trending videos in which some Igbo traders are attacked while trying to register for their Permanent Voters Card (PVC).
Mep, however, charged Nigerian youths to go and get their PVCs ready despite any odds, as this is the only weapon they have to fight against any insecurity and inhuman treatment in the country because the PVC will give them the right to vote for a credible candidate who will protect the interest of the country.
He also clears the doubt of those that do say that their vote doesn’t count, by letting them know that if their vote doesn’t count politicians wouldn’t have been giving people money to vote for them.
In his exact reaction, Mrp tweeted this;
The attack on my Igbo people who went to register for their PVCs is unacceptable! God is watching!
Nigerian Youths! Our only weapon now is our PVC if your vote doesn’t count, nobody will give you money to vote for him or her.
However, there are no official statements supporting this purported attack on Igbo traders. There is a need for relevant government officials to look into this allegation and fish out the perpetrators.
