Amid the ongoing saga involving his educational background, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s critics appear to have seized the opportunity to verbally attack the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential flag bearer on social media.
A few hours ago, a former ministerial aide by the name of Henry Shield Nwazuruahu, took to his Twitter handle to debunk claims from Asiwaju’s camp concerning the development of the country’s commercial hub, Lagos State.
In his tweet, Henry, who was once a special aide to Governor Mohammed Bala when the latter was FCT Minister, lampooned opposition political parties for not challenging claims that Tinubu is responsible for the development of Lagos State.
“If there was sensible opposition in Lagos. No sane person will come here to say Tinubu developed that state,” he wrote.

For all who have followed the presidential race with keen interest since it began, it is common knowledge that the astronomical development of Lagos is often credited to Bola Tinubu who was a two-term governor of the state (1999-2007).
In fact, the city’s remarkable development is considered to be the centerpiece of Asiwaju’s presidential campaign as the former governor does not hesitate to point to the state as evidence of of his credentials in the area of governance.

As expected, Henry’s remark has stirred the hornet’s nest as many of his followers did not hesitate to air their opinions in the comments section.
While some persons agreed with his views, others, however, refuted his claim.
