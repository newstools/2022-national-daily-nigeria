A Marilyn Monroe collector claimed that there was permanent damage on the iconic dress Monroe wore on the 45th birthday of John F Kennedy.
Some photographs taken in the last week by a collector, Scott Fortner, who works to authenticate and verify Monroe memorabilia, appeared to show stretched and buckled fabric and missing crystals on the back of the dress.
Prior to the Met Gala, Kim realised she couldn’t slip into the gown so she underwent an extreme weight-loss regime, given the dress cannot be altered.
