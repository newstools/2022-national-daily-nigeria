Senator Shehu Sani has commended a member of the House of Representatives, Bamidele Salam, for his courage to embark on one-man protest of the hostages kidnapped by bandits from the Abuja/Kaduna train. The federal lawmaker, displaying a placard to send his message, demanded President Muhammadu Buhari to arise and secure the freedom of hostage kidnapped by bandits in the Abuja/Kaduna train who are still in captivity. Senator Sani stated that the action of the federal lawmaker from Osun State is a challenge to other federal and Kaduna State lawmakers to also rise and get the appropriate authorities to perform their responsibilities of securing lives and property of Nigerian citizens.
Sani on his official twitter handle Senator Shehu Sani @ShehuSani, wrote: “The one man protest led by Rep Bamidele Salam (Osun) over the Abuja Kaduna hostages is commendable. This is a challenge to Kaduna/Federal lawmakers who have not shown responsibility and courage in holding the Government to account on this issue.”
