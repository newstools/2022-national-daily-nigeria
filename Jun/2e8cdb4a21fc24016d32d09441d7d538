A Chieftain of the All Progressive Congress, and a strong supporter of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Mr Joe Igbokwe, has pleaded with APC Leaders in Rivers State, to quickly convince the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, to join APC. This statement is contained in a post he made on his Facebook page.
Recall that Nyesom Wike lost in the PDP presidential primary election. He was defeated Alhaji Atiku, who emerged as the presidential candidate of the PDP. Also, the governor of Delta State, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, just emerged as the running mate of Atiku Abubakar, ahead of Nyesom Wike.
In his exact post, Joe Igbokwe stated:
“Governor Wike is a big fish and a great performer in Nigeria at the moment.Let us beg him to join us in APC asap. Let our leaders move to Rivers State to perfect it.”
I must say that nothing is practically impossible in the Nigerian political terrain. Otherwise, I would have stated that there is no way Wike will accept to join APC, where the likes of Abe and Amechi have built strong hold at Rivers State. Well, if Femi Fani Kayode can join APC, indeed anyone can defect anytime.
