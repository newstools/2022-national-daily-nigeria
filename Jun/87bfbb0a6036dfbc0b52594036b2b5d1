Nigerians online have taken to the comment section of the Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party, former Governor Peter Obi to spill out their minds after he called out on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to swiftly attend to the difficulty of voters registering for the forthcoming presidential election.
More than ever, the Youths have shown that they are ready to actively participate in the decision of who becomes the President of the country. Over the last few years, there have been complaints about the inability of the current administration to relate to the Youth. This was evident during the Endsars protest in October 2020 which was targeted toward ending police brutality in the country. The way the government handled the situation then was faulted by many Nigerian Youths which then led to the resolution that come 2023, they would come out in large numbers to vote for a better candidate.

This, however, led to the inability of the Electoral Commission to effectively attend to hundreds of thousands of voters. While reacting to this, Peter Obi said, “Information reaching me indicates that voter registration across Nigeria, more so in the South East, is dogged by inertia & bureaucratic bottlenecks. I respectfully call on @inecnigeria to facilitate speedy registration of Nigerians to enable them to exercise their voting rights”.
