Several groups that constitute the All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders Forum on Sunday declared Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State the best running mate for the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 general elections. The Forum, therefore, demanded the APC leadership of the party and President Muhammadu Buhari to adopt Zulum as the party’s vice-presidential candidate for the APC joint ticket with Tinubu in 2023.
The APC Stakeholders Forum comprising of 840 groups expressed that the adoption of Governor Zulum by thet party as Tinubu’s running mate will boost the party’s chances to win the 2023 general elections.
The National Chairman of the APC Stakeholders Forum, Abdullahi Aliyu Katsina, in an interaction on Sunday with APC leaders in the seven states of the Northwest in Katsina, insisted that only Governor Zulum, who he said, has won the hearts of Nigerians through his exemplary leadership over the last three years can make people vote for the APC in the 2023 elections. He warned that the APC may be defeated in the 2023 presidential election if the party does not choose Governor Zulum as Tinubu’s running mate.
Katsina had declared: “Our request is open and is no more than taking Governor Zulum of Borno State as the vice-presidential candidate of APC.
“We understand that only Governor Zulum can galvanize the votes from entire 19 northern states.
“To avoid losing the election, the only person in Nigeria today who can bring the desired success for the party is Governor Zulum. Anybody today that is picked as vice-presidential candidate for the APC, if not Zulum, may not give us the desired success.
“Failure for the party to pick Zulum, it may end up losing the election.”
