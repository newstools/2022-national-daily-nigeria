Rising from its emergency meeting on Thursday in Lagos, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) vowed to mobilize its members against voting for any party with Muslim-Muslim ticket in next year’s election.
National President, PFN, Bishop Francis Wale Oke also declared Sunday, June 26, 2022 a PVC Day in all its churches nationwide, where members would be made to show their PVCs before entering the church.
Oke admitted that Nigeria is currently at a cross road, particularly as the 2023 elections approached.
He said the 2023 election carried the potential to unite Nigeria across ethnic and religious lines and that it could also scatter the nation if things were not done properly.
He said the church would move against Christian-Christian ticket and Muslim-Muslim ticket, saying that it would help to bring down tension in the midst of killings.

“A Christian-Christian and Muslim-Muslim ticket will not work for Nigeria. Muslim-Muslim ticket is unfair, it means over 54 percent of the Christian populace will be marginalized.
Saying that the church would continue to contribute its quota to indivisible Nigeria, the PFN Boss Warned against Muslim-Muslim ticket by any party in the presidential election.
Oke stated that not only PFN had been talking about it, but that the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN had also been kicking against such a move.
“We are not talking about the Muslim-Muslim ticket on the basis that we are Christians, but on basis of fairness, equity,” he said.
“We want a just nation that caters for all its citizens no matter the religion, we encourage all believers to register and get their PVCs and wait for the instruction from church founders how they will go about it,” he added.
