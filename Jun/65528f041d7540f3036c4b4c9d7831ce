Gov Simon Lalong of Plateau had declared June 27 and June 28 as work-free days to enable eligible voters in the state to register for their PVC.
The Director of NOA in Plateau , Mrs Kaneng Pam, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Jos .
“We need everyone eligible to go and register. Parents should encourage children to register for PVC and vote when the time comes.
“The registration is not for competitive reasons but to enable Nigerians to perform their civic responsibilities.
” We are happy with the Plateau government for declaring work-free days on Monday and Tuesday for civil servants and citizens in general to partake in the continuous voters registration.
“I urge civil servants to key into this and take the exercise seriously,” she said.
She urged the people of Plateau to be responsible and shun nonchalance towards the exercise, saying failure to register implies living with the choices of others in the forthcoming elections.
