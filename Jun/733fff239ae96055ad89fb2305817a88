Tweeps have directed their anger at the Minister Of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, who they blamed for the decision of the Federal Government.
Popular tweep, Nefertiti said, “Sunday Dare is reckless, but GMB had no business pulling the Girls out of ALL Int’l Basketball competitions for a whooping 2 yrs.
There are many ways the FG could have resolved the power tussle inside the Basketball Federation. Like Buhari, Abacha made Nigeria miss two African Cup Of Nations.
Mr Folarin tweeted, “This, right here, (D’Tigress withdrawal from world cup) is Sunday Dare’s legacy as sports minister. Not that he cares though, but it has to be pressed home, so that posterity judges him accordingly.”
Tosin Banwo OBE said, “Totally on the sports minister-Sunday Dare, no world cup participation in two sports, what is even more worrisome in this case is that this team qualified.”
Chukwuemeka hinged the debacle on bad governance, saying, “Sunday Dare and FG have killed the dream of these young Nigerians to represent us at the World Cup. Bad governance na your mate?”
The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development had in May announced the withdrawal of the nation’s basketball teams from international competition for a period of two years following what it called, “Unending crisis which has plagued and nearly crippled the development of basketball in Nigeria.”
