Since the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party NNPP, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso revealed that his party is in talks with the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, over the possibility of forming an alliance, the issue of who will be the running mate between the two candidates has been generating reactions.
Yesterday, the Thisday reports that the spokesman of the NNPP, Dr Agbo Major, said the only condition for the collaboration between the two parties is for Obi to accept to be the running mate.
He said they have been receiving numerous calls from people that the only acceptable permutation is for Obi to be Kwankwaso’s vice.
However, the national chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure, in his reaction said Obi will never accept such arrangement.

In an interview with the Daily Independent today, Mr Abure said Peter Obi has said in interviews and has told them that he will not accept to be a vice presidential candidate to any person.
He echoed the sentiments shared by Ohaneze Ndigbo and other leaders of Southern socio-cultural groups, that in the in the spirit of equity, justice and fairness, the next president of Nigeria should come from the South, and not just the South, but the Southeast.
He revealed that Labour Party is talks with other political parties and may pick a Northern running mate from any of those parties.
The lack of compromise over who will be the running mate means people like human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju and others who have been hoping to see a merger between the two parties to challenge APC and PDP in 2023 may be disappointed.
