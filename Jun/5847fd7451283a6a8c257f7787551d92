The presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Sunday suffered home rejection on his return to Lagos after the APC national convention in Abuja a fortnight ago. Unlike the usual fanfare around the APC national leader in Lagos, and contrary to expectations that residents of the state would have joined Tinubu in celebrating his victory and emergence as the APC presidential candidate at the presidential primaries, the former Lagos State governor was attacked on his arrival in the state by angry mob, who are yet to be identified.
The mob attacked the convoy of Tinubu at Adeniji environs of Isale Eko while departing the palace of the  Oba of Lagos, having driven to the palace from the Airport. The angry mob struck when the APC presidential candidate left palace of the Oba of Lagos on the way to his residence at Bourdilon, Ikoyi.
While Tinubu’s personal car had passed the scene, the mob ‘ambushed’ the vehicle conveying journalists and the backup security vehicle of the convoy, throwing stones and other dangerous weapons as the convoy drove off the palace. Some of the rioters, also displaying swords and cutlasses, smashed side mirrors and front windscreens of some vehicles in the convoy, injuring a few journalists.
Tinubu had arrived the Presidential Wing of Murtala Muhammad International Airport, Ikeja, and from there proceeded to the palace of the Oba of Lagos.
The mission of the angry mob was not known, neither did the protesters make any demand.
Meanwhile, some APC stakeholders in Lagos State insinuated that the attack may not be unconnected with discontentment of some party members in the state over the APC primaries in Lagos which several members complained were not transparent and certain candidates were imposed on the party by the godfather.
