PDP’s presidential primary loser Ayo Fayose has taken hia anger out on one of his aides who betrayed his during the PDP presidential primary on the weekend.
Hon. Sunday Anifowose, aka Sunshine, has been allegedly sacked by Fayose for allegedly voting Atiku Abubakar.
Sunshine was not the only one of the Ekiti delegates who ratted on the former governor at the primary in Abuja on the weekend.
“Fayose is still making his findings to know the number of delegates from Ekiti that flouted his order, but since Sunshine’s vote for Atiku is clearly confirmed, Fayose has vowed to deal with him seriously for such action, despite the immediate verbal molestation and harassment of Sunshine on Saturday evening by Fayose at the Abuja hotel, where the state delegates were lodged,” the Daily Post quoted a source as saying.
While Atiku garnered 371 votes to crush most of the other aspirants, Fayose scored zero.
The primary elections conducted across the nation so far in the lead-up to the 2023 elections have been condemned as highly monetized—or dollarized.
