A renowned female human rights activist ion Nigeria, Comrade Aisha Yesufu, on Tuesday urged political parties to unite for a stronger coalition to unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. She also cited reasons why Nigerians should be mobilized for protest votes on APC at the polling units in 2023.
Aisha got instant support from another activist, Deji Adeyanju, who explained the circumstances that made the 2015 alliance successful against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Aisha in her official twitter handle Aisha Yesufu @AishaYesufu wrote: “1) Political parties came together; 2) People were tired of the killings and insecurity. 3) the impunity of the ruling party made them to lose 5 sitting Governors. 4) the then, new Electoral Act was a game changer with the card reader which curtailed the rigging.”
Deji in his expression of support clarified: Comrade Deji Adeyanju @adeyanjudeji “To understand how to defeat an incumbent, we must ask ourselves how APC did it in 2015. “Everybody came together to do it. They also prevented rigging of votes.
“Although the vote buying concept was not this bad; hunger was also not this prevalent in the country.”
