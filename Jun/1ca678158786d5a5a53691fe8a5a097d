The report reaching National Daily reveals that former Manchester United star Sergio Romero is interested in a return to Old Trafford to replace the outgoing Dean Henderson as the Argentine feels that he still got things unfinished with the Red Devils.
The 35-year old former Sampdoria goalie had departed Old Trafford only two years ago, but would now fancy a return to the Theatre of Dreams to renew his contest with David de Gea.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
National Daily understands that United stopper Henderson will join Nottingham Forest on loan this week, with Erik ten Hag making it clear to the England goalkeeper that De Gea will be his number one.
The club have searched for a new number two but to no avail, with Tom Heaton currently in line to provide competition for De Gea.
But Romero is keen on taking on the role again following his release from Venezia.
Romero was unhappy with how his United career ended, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer forcing him to train with the reserves after he was displaced by Henderson.
But a source told the MEN that he would jump at the chance of returning to the club as he still has a lot of love for United.
United, for their part, have not made an offer for Romero but he could be a viable option.
