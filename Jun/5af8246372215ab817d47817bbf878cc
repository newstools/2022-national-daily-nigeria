Malam Auwal Baba, JED Regional Manager, Gombe, stated this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria in Gombe on Monday.
He said those that were residing less than 11 meters away from poles were liable for dangers such as electrocution.
He alleged that most of the violators of the rule were people who mostly employed the services of non-JED staff for illegal connections and other offences.
“Employing the service of those that were not company staff is illegal at the same time risky, capable of causing havoc to people.
“There are people in the community who were known as “NEPA” and virtually most of them were engaged in illegal connections,” he said.
According to him, those that were looking for short cut to follow, patronised “NEPA” agents
He further advised Gombe residents to always contact the company for services, promising that they would provide more prepaid meters to the state.
