A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Who is also a former senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Shehu Sani, has commented on President Buhari’s trip to Spain. In what is suppose to be a joke, Shehu Sani alleged that President Buhari may have gone to Spain for consultation on his replacement.
Shehu Sani’s tweet is directed at the seeming difficulty the ruling All Progressive Congress are facing in getting someone that can compete and perhaps, win Atiku Abubakar. Recall that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar emerged as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.
Not too long, President Buhari left Nigeria to Spain. Before he left, he had pleaded with APC chieftains to allow him select who will succeed him. He also pleaded them to assist him in this selection process. This is the direction Shehu Sani’s tweet emanated from.
Check his exact tweet below:
“Baba has gone to Madrid Searching for a Messi or Ronaldo who can defeat Atiku.”
I think Shehu Sani doesn’t literarily mean ‘Ronaldo’ or ‘Messi’, but more like a metaphorical projection. He may imply that President Buhari may have gone to Spain to get a serious political dribbler and political strategist that will succeed him. This is my opinion actually.
