A consumer, Mose Oluwasegunfunmi Temidayo, called on the company to restore power to his Ojo community, adding that in the last four months power supply to the community has been blinking.
Another consumer, Godwin Arthur Ntefreh, said: “I am really not happy with the rate of power distribution in Ibeju Lekki. They brought the light just for two days and then collected the bill from us and took the light again for 4 days now, no power at Awoyaya and Ologufe after collecting our money. You people should better restore light or else I won’t pay the next bill. Imagine making payments of 21,000 Naira monthly, and you don’t even have power for 4 hours in a day”.
