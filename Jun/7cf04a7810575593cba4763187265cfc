There are emerging pressures on Chelsea’s midfielder, N’Golo Kante, to leave Chelsea and join Manchester United during the summer transfer period.
A former Manchester United defender, John O’Shea, has been putting pressure on Kante to move to Man U in the new season as a suitable replacement for Paul Pogba who has departed Man U with other midfielders who include Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Jesse Lingard. The departure of the four midfielders has placed Manchester United under pressure for midfielders to strengthen the team for the new season.
John O’Shea was of the view that if Manchester United can sign  Kante or two other players he also identified to join Man U, it would be a big boost for everyone in United.
