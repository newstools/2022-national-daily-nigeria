The All Progressives Congress, APC, House of Representatives ticket, of the politically prime Alimosho Federal Constituency in Lagos State, cannot by consensus be a dash to Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola promoted aspirant, Hon Ganiyu Adele Ayuba.
It is open knowledge that Aregbesola’s right hand and coordinator, Alhaji Abdullahi Ayinde Enilolobo in collusion with His Excellency Governor Babajide Olushola Sanwo-Olu, foisted Hon Ayuba on Alimosho federal constituency, in difference to the serving Minister of Interior, after the failed primary wherein two lives were lost during the fracas that characterized the Friday 27th May exercise.
Aregbesola, a frontline promoter of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo presidential project, fell out with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu over what he described as hauntings, greed and overbearing nature of the now presidential candidate of the ruling APC.
Alimosho APC is demanding a review of the processes that culminated in the adoption of an Aregbesola backed aspirant, as APC House of Representatives candidate in Alimosho federal constituency, so much so that Hon Ayuba’s campaign so far is being funded by the six council chairmen in the constituency, on the behest of the former Governor of Osun State.
