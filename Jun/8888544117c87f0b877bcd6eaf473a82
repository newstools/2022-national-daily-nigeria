President Muhammadu Buhari has claimed the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) government has made Nigeria’s economy and security better in the past seven years. President Buhari in a media interaction claimed that his administration has elevated Nigeria’s economy which he considered Africa’s largest economy in a better position than he met it in 2015, citing increase of investments in infrastructure, recovery of stolen funds and improved security.
The president, however, could not explain  why there is so much hardship in the country with all the claimed achievements.
 President Buhari also claimed that the APC government under his leadership recovered over N152 billion by from January to December 2021. He claimed that $386 million, 1.1 million pounds and 1.7 million Saudi Riyals were also recovered nu his administration in 2021.
President Buhari highlighted: “Starting with our whistle blowing policy enacted in my first year in office, hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned. Working with our international partners, hundreds of millions of various currencies have been returned from abroad – primarily from the UK, US, and Switzerland – and used as social and welfare funds, distributed directly to the poorest, during the covid pandemic, and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure – roads, bridges, rail, and power.”
The president had stated: “Those partners refused to return these monies held for decades to previous Nigerian administrations in the certainty that they would simply be re-stolen. They changed their approach with us because they knew my administration could be trusted.”
