Nigerian journalist and former presidential aspirant on the platform of the people’s democratic party, Dele Momodu took to social media just a few minutes ago to react to the emergence of the national leader of all progressives congress, Ahmed Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the all progressives congress.
While congratulating Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Dele Momodu submitted that the 2023 presidential race will now be a straight fight and a battle royale between the two old buddies, Ahmed Bola Tinubu and the presidential candidate of the people’s democratic party, Atiku Abubakar.
From Dele’s reaction, he considers only Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar as the major contenders for the number one seat of the country. His submission could also imply that one of these two politicians stands the chance of winning the general elections come 2023.
You will recall that Dele Momodu contested for the PDP’s presidential ticket and lost the election by scoring one of the least number of votes cast.
