APC national leader Bola Tinubu scored 1271 votes while Bakare scored zero, though he claimed he passed  integrity test in the race on which he spent N100 million to enter.
On Sunday, Bakare congratulated Tinubu, revealing why he won.
“I congratulate the winner of the APC presidential primaries, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for his victory,” he told  his church member.
“His emergence as the flag bearer and presidential candidate of the APC is a testament to his significant contributions to the course of the South West as well as his labour towards the formation and establishment of the APC as I have said in times past.
“I, therefore, extend best wishes to him as he proceeds on the campaign trail towards the 2023 general elections,” the cleric said.
