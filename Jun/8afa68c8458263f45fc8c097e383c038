Nigerian human rights activist, Comrade Deji Adeyanju has once again dragged the ruling All Progressives Congress. This time, he accused the ruling party of sponsoring oil bunkering in the country.
Comrade Deji Adeyanju laid this accusation on the ruling All Progressives Congress on his Facebook handle.
Deji Adeyanju who laid the accusation on his Facebook post said that the craziest form of corruption he has ever heard under the ruling All Progressives Congress is that the owners of oil fields are the ones that collude with oil thieves to steal and divert crude oil so that they don’t pay the expected percentage to the Government.
He argued that if the above claim is not the case, then how can the situation where 90 percent of the product is stolen be explained?
According to Deji Adeyanju, no level of oil bunkering can lead to 90 percent of oil theft if there is no internal collusion.
For clarity, Deji Adeyanju believes that the reported 90 percent oil theft is not as a result of external oil bunkering alone. To him, some oil fields owners internally sponsor oil thieves to steal or bunker crude oil leading to high percent of oil bunkering.
Deji Adeyanju dragged the ruling party because all these are going on under the party’s administration.
He however said that the country’s economy’s dependency on oil is the reason why there is no sufficient forex.
Do you agree with Deji Adeyanju that the ruling party has a hand in oil bunkering leading to 90 percent theft?
