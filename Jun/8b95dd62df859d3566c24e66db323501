An Igbo Chieftain in Jos, Dr. Faith Onyema, has dismissed the fear that Northern Nigeria will not vote for the Labour Party Presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, saying that the 2023 presidential election will be based on the quality of the candidates and not the party.
“It is no longer the party but the person. People are tired of parties and are now looking for who the cap fits irrespective of the party he or she belongs to”, he said.
Onyema who is the leader of Igbos in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, noted that the former Anambra State governor’s presidential bid is gathering momentum because Nigerians across board are tired of politicians being recycled without bringing anything on the table.
Speaking with our correspondent in Jos Sunday, the Igbo Chieftain explained that the support Obi is getting, especially from youths in north-central Nigeria, is because the region has suffered from wanton killings of innocent citizens.
“Youths are clamoring for Peter Obi because Nigerian politicians have disappointed the people, from the economy to the security of lives and properties, Nigerians have suffered a great deal of loss.
“The just concluded primaries of both APC and PDP has also shown that it is only politicians with money bags that clinch to power, a situation the youths want to change.
“Peter Obi is a revolutionary movement especially among the youths whose futures are being threatened by a failed government”, Onyema said.
