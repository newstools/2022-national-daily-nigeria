It’s old news at this point that Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi openly lambasted South East delegates for fundraising against him at the most recent national convention of the All Progressive Congress. Keep in mind that the recently concluded primaries resulted in Asiwaju Tinubu being chosen as the party’s nominee, while the governor and the other candidates all came up short.
On yesterday’s episode of journalists hangout on TVC, popular broadcaster and award-winning journalist Babajide Otitoju commented on the situation, laying the responsibility on politicians in the South East for not working together. According to Babajide’s claims, Buhari originally picked a running mate from the South East who was later rejected. He cited 2003’s rejection of the late Ojukwu as an illustration. “I recall that Buhari tried twice before without success to choose a running mate from the South East. Even if a candidate hails from the East, it doesn’t guarantee he’ll get his fellow Easterners to vote for him. In 2003, Ojukwu’s natives unanimously rejected him.” Statement by Babajide.
