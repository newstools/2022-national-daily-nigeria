Fayose said this in an open letter to Tinubu on Monday which he personally signed.
Abiola was denied victory after the result was controversially annulled y then military President Ibrahim Babangida. His successor ad late President Sani Abacha detained Abiola for declaring himself as president. Abiola died four years later.
In his open letter, Fayose said it was obvious that Tinubu was swimming against the tide and he needed to proceed with extreme caution.
“Going by the handwritings that are now clearly on the wall, if I may consider sir, I see you as one that may be swimming against the political tide of the cabal in your party. They are equally preparing for your actions and reactions and are fully set to contain same as they did to both Awolowo and Abiola,” the PDP stalear and former governor wrote.
“Unfortunately, your kingdom has been badly balkanised if what happened in Abeokuta is anything to go by. The book of Proverbs 22 verse 3 reads, ‘Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it but unthinking people will walk into it’.”
