British PM Boris Johnson knows little about Nigeria political system though he and his country feign interest in Nigeria.
It may amuse Nigerians to know Johnson just learnt Nigeria runs two-term limit for elective offices in the executive arms of government.
So on Thursday, at the 26th Comonwealth Heads of Government Meeting  (CHOGM)  in Kigali, Rwanda, the embattled prime minister asked Buhari if he was contesting again.
It was a big surprise Johnson had no idea Buhari’s partyman Bola Tinubu is scrambling with PDP Atiku Abubakar to succeed the president.
Buhari himself got wowed.
“Another term for me?”
“No!” Buhari answered himself
“The first person who tried it didn’t end very well.”
The punchline made even for a bigger laugh.
Johnson surely would have no idea of the incident though he was a newspaperman about that time when former President Olusegun Obasanjo attempted to amend the constitution to allow him run for a third term.
The attempt ended up in disaster.
