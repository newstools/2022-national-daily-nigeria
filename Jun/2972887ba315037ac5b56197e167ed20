Some yet to be identified gunmen are said to have invaded a Celestial Church of Christ, Oshofa Parish at Wasimi, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun State on Tuesday, abducting a pastor and a Sunday School teacher.
The gunmen were said to have kidnapped the Assistant Shepherd of the parish, Oluwaseun Ajose and a Sunday school teacher identified as Dagunro Ayobami.
The two worshippers were dragged away by their abductors around 12 am on Tuesday.
The Shepherd of the church, Oluwatomisin Ehuwaojomo, confirmed the incident in a telephone conversation.
According to Ehuwaojomo, the abductors called him and demanded a ransom of N50 million for the release of the two church workers.

The Shepherd, while saying the incident was extremely unexpected, sought the support of the police and other security agencies in rescuing the victims.
He said he was not in the church when the incident happened, adding that he was sleeping in his room at the time.
“When my Assistant Shepherd called me almost two hours after they left, the kidnappers refused to speak with me twice. But on his third attempt, they spoke with me and demanded N50 million ransom.
“I told them that I am a servant of God, nobody pays me a salary. I have spoken with the Ogun State Commissioner of Police. The command is on the matter.”
Contacted, the Ogun State Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he was yet to be briefed about the incident, promising to revert.
Recalls that Oyeyemi had on several occasions warned religious organisations against organising night programmes.
Where such night services become extremely expedient, Oyeyemi advised that requests for police protection be sought by the organisers.
This, he said, would stop the abduction of worshippers during vigils.
