A member of the All Progressives Congress has responded to Deji Adeyanju’s statement, noting that many members of the ruling party never wish him well.

Deji Adeyanju has been proactive towards the forthcoming presidential election as he has criticized almost all the major and popular political parties that will be contesting in the 2023 election.
Adeyanju, who always finds flaws in political parties but seems more passionate about the opposition parties dethroning the ruling All Progressive Congress in the next presidential election, revealed on his Facebook page that many supporters of the APC are wishing him bad.
This was said by the activist while claiming that almost all of the popular political parties’ supporters despised him.However, Ayekooto, a staunch supporter of the ruling party, reacted to Adeyanju’s statement by asking why the APC would wish him dead. He noted that his LG, state and region are already controlled overwhelmingly by the APC. He noted that the ruling party can’t wish him bad things because his presence is even a major comic relief to them and his irrelevance statement is very entertaining.
