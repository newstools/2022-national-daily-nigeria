Alabi made the pledge on Friday while interacting with the members of Crime Reporters Association of Nigeria (CRAN), during the association’s maiden congress held under its new President, Mr Olalekan Olabulor.
He commended members of the association for their support and called for more collaborations to secure the state from criminal elements.
“We must be partners in progress; we must work together; I cannot do the work alone as a policeman without the help of the media.
“The public cannot know what we are doing if such activities; success over criminals are not reported by the media,” he said.
The commissioner of police said he was open to criticisms, stressing that CRAN leadership should check fake news writers amongst members.
Alabi, while noting that fake news was capable of destabilising the state, expressed concerns over fake news being spread by online media.
Earlier, the president of CRAN commended Alabi for the attention given to the association, assuring him of collaboration to fight crime in the state.
Olabulor informed the commissioner that members of the association were responsible professionals and will not thrive on fake news.
The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the association had on May 6, elected new executives led by Olabulo of the Tribune Newspapers as President.
Other are Evelyn Usman of Vanguard, Vice President; Niran Odufayo of Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, Secretary; and Chiemele Ezeobi of Thisday, Treasurer.
