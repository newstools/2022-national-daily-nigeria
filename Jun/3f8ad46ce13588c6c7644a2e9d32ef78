The Stamford Bridge club have completed the signing of Ève Perisset under Todd Boehyl era as new owner of the north London club.
The Blues who were hit with a series of government sanctions in the wake of Russian’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year under former owner Roman Abramovich were unable to negotiate new contracts across its men’s, women’s and youth teams have finally been able to bring the 27-year-old from Bordeaux on a three-year deal.
Chelsea fans will hope that the arrival of Perisset as an addition to Emma Hayes’ side will mark the arrival of more stars to Stamford Bridge with the lifting of the embargo
‘It’s a fantastic honour to join Chelsea and to be the first French female player to become a Blue! I am very thankful for the opportunity that has been given to me,’ Perisset told the club’s official website.
‘The time was right for me to make this big move to London and join the English Super League and I cannot wait to meet the team and the fans later this summer at Kingsmeadow and at the famous Stamford Bridge!’
Manager Hayes added: said: ‘Eve brings a wealth of experience and is a versatile player who is able to play in both full-back positions and midfield.
‘A tenacious defender, with her mentality and professionalism we have no doubt she will complement the group well.
‘We really look forward to welcoming Eve to the team later this summer as we head into the new season.’
