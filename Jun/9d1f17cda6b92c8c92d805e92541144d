Following the victory of the APC national leader Bola Tinubu as the party’s presidential candidate, the prospect of a southwestern president is generating tensions.
The Fayoses, for instance, are now at daggers drawn.
Forr Gov Peter Fayose is a known supporter of the PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar, and it seems the presidential aspirant who scored zero has a stake in the northerner’s presidency.
Although he is not yet on the longlist of  Atiku’s favourites for the V.P candidate, Fayose’s major interest is big enough for him to sacrifice his brother.
So when Isaac dish dirt on Atiku on social media recently, the former governor respond with fire.
“Mr Isaac Fayose comments on Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is sad and undeserving,” he tweeted June 8. “I seriously dissociate myself from such comments, and make bold to say that he’s on his own.”
According to him, Isaac should take responsibility for his motive for saying that sad thing.
“More importantly, sharing the same surname does not imply my complicity in his sad narrative.”
Isaac however responded later, stating how his brother surprised him by disowning him over the comments on power shift.
“I wondered why you did not dissociate yourself from my comments concerning Makinde and Dino Melaye all because it was in your favour,” he tweeted.
“Sir, blood ties goes way beyond politics and I think am old enough to have my own opinion on issues.”
Isaac refused to cut the umbilical cord that tied him with his brother Peter.
“I wish you well… and I remain your brother.”
