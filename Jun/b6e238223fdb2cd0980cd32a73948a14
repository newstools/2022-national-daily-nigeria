The Zamfara State Government has disclosed that the state is having negotiation with West President Muhammadu Buhari on the order to residents in the state to acquire guns and protect themselves and their communities against bandits terrorizing their communities.
The Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, and the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, DIG Mamman Tsafe (Rtd), in a media interaction in Gusau, clarified the security measures of the state government announced on Sunday to bandits in the state, saying that the state government is talking with the President on the issue of civilians acquiring guns for self defence.
The Information decried that the security crisis in Zamfara State has turned the state to a colony of banditry in Nigeria.
The commissioner noted that though the Federal Government had for long placed embargo on issuance of licenses to individuals to possess arms, he, however, argued that the security situation in Zamfara State is deteriorating and becoming uncontrollable. This, he said, prompted the need to dialogue with President Muhammadu Buhari to grant the state the authority to allow residents access licenses to acquire guns to defend themselves.
Zamfara State government had on Sunday announced that the state government will soon commence the distribution of 500 forms to citizens for processing of licenses from the Commissioner of Police to acquire guns for self-defence.
