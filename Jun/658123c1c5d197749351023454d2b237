The APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu has reacted to the excitement in the rumour mill about the ruling party choosing a Muslim as his running mate.
He insisted nobody, instituton or group can impose aybody on him.
According to him, the peddlers of the Muslim-Muslim tiket are undemocratic elements scared of his emergence as the APC presidential candidate.
“The VP slot belongs to the northeastern region and particularly the Christians, but consultations are yet ongoing as to who will be decided,” he said while addressing journalists in Ekiti on Tuesday.
There have been reports in the media stating former SGF Babagana Kingibe sent three names to Tinubu, all Muslims, including UN Dep. Sec-Gen Amina Mohammed, Borno Umar Zulum, and a former presidential adviser.
Some also reported the northern governors are meeting President Muhammadu Buhari to present a list comprising AGF Malami, Borno former Gov. Kashim Shettima who is also an ally of Tinubu.
The only Tinubu’s Christian associate in the northeast remains former SGF Lawan Babachir who worked with the APC candidate in the run-up to the party primary election.
