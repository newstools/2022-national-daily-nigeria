The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has intensified efforts to overrun the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, and of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential election. Obi, on Tuesday, took his mobilization net to the Organised Labour, meeting with the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) to mobilise the support of the Nigerian workers for the 2023 general elections.
The Labour Party is dominated by the NLC and TUC to promote the interests of workers in the country’s governance and politics.
Obi has been developing a rising profile in the civil society community, and the middle class in the country.  However, the LP does not have the type of political structure the PDP or APC has to prosecute general elections, though Obi’s membership has been increasing the number of supporters and followers of the party towards the 2023 elections in the country.
