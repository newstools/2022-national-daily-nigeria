Mr Deji Adeyanju, a Nigerian activist and convener of concerned Nigerians, has taken to his official Facebook platform to reveal the likely outcome of a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the APC.

According to Mr Deji, considering that Mr Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a Muslim, if the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), goes ahead to pick another northern Muslim as Mr Tinubu’s running mate, he expects the entire opposition to unite against the APC.
Mr Adeyanju is very popular for his criticisms towards political leaders and the government in general as he has always said that he advocates for the rights of the common people.

However, there had been controversies within the ruling APC as to whom will become the running mate of their presidential candidate as many Christian groups have warned against Mr Bola Ahmed Tinubu picking a fellow Muslim as his running mate.
