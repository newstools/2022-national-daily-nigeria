Most times we engage in habits that may seem harmless but are actually destructive. The liver is a very vital part of the body which carried out several functions like metabolism of protein, carbs and fats, storage of blood etc
There some bad habits many persons engage in out of sheer ignorance which could damage the liver in the long run. I’ll like to enlighten you on some of these habits according to WebMd
1. Eating too much sugar- The liver converts a type of sugar called fructose into fats. Taking more of refined sugars and high fructose foods can result in accumulation of fats which harms the liver. To maintain a health liver it is important to reduce alcohol or foods that contains lots of added sugars like sodas
2. Taking herbal supplement without caution- No matter how natural and safe you think a herb is, it is important that you still consult your doctor before taking it because taking some herbs like kava kava can cause liver damage, hepatitis or liver failure
3. Taking too much Vitamin A from supplements- You might find this surprising but as important as vitamin A is, it is harmful to take its supplements excessive. We can get vitamin A in foods and fruits naturally especially the red, yellow and orange ones. So you should reduce your intake of vitamin A supplements.
4. Soft drink- Taking soft drinks during occasions, before or after meals and every other time you feel like, is damaging your liver. It is important that you cut down your intake of sodas to the minimum especially if you already have a liver problem, you should drink more of water.
5. Using acetaminophen- This drug helps to treat sore backs, headaches, colds and pains etc. However, it has been discovered that taking too much acetaminophen is associated with liver failure
