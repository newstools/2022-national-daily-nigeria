PDP presidential primary loser and Rivers Gov Nyesom Wike who vowed he will never paly the second fiddle is having a rethink.
Apart from his intense lobbying to snatch the V.P slot, others who are rooting for him have started pithing the party’s NWC.
A party stalwart Charles Kalu has written to the national chairman Iyorcha Ayu to consider Wike who came second for the slot
In a letter addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Dr. Iyorcha Ayu, at the party’s Wadata Plaza headquarters, Kalu argued that by coming second in the party’s presidential primary, Wike had demonstrated strength and capacity that would help the PDP garner more votes in the South-South geo-political zone as well as the South-East.
“He is such a leader capable of galvanising block votes for the party considering the degree of support and popularity he enjoys from the referred zone, including the South East,” the letter stated.
Wike is not the only one eyeing the slot. Delta Gov Ifeanyi Okowa, too, has showed interest.
Party’s candidate Atiku Abubakar has penciled down a nubr of V.P candidate, and Wike is not among them.
In fact  reports have it that Atiku is considering bringing his last running mate and LP candidate Peter Obi back.
Wike blew hot after hi colleague and ally Aminu Tambuwal stepped down for Atiku during the primary, blaming the north for hogging power.
He insisted he will never be a second citizen in his country
