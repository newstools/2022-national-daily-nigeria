Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna senator, has posted the result of the 1979 presidential election on his verified Twitter handle.
Nigeria had its first presidential election in 1979 after years of military rule. The election ushered in the second republic, which started in October 1979 and ended with another military coup in December 1983.
According to the results posted by Shehu Sani, more than 16 million Nigerians voted in the election in 19 states of the Federation at that time.
The candidate of the National Party of Nigeria, Shehu Shagari, won the presidential election with more than five million votes. Chief Obafemi Awolowo of the Unity Party of Nigeria was the first runner-up, followed by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.
