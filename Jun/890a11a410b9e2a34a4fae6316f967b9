Senator Abubakar Girei claims the election was free and fair and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo won it though the party declared APC national leader Tinuu winerthe election he declared free and fair but party flag went elsewhere.
According to him, the Vice President never encouraged vote-buying during the just-concluded presidential primary of the party won by the APC’s National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, with 1,271 votes.
“As the Vice President, he is an heir to the throne, a crown prince, who should have been given the right of first refusal in the contest in which he offered himself to serve the nation, and in which he had national acceptability,} he told newsmen in Kaduna on Monday
“He had the best speech and his manifesto at the convention was the best. He identified problems and proffered solutions to them more than all other aspirants. For someone who had never contested any election before and with no politicking knowledge, to emerge third at the convention, I consider him the greatest winner of the convention.
“I have no doubt in my mind that Nigeria has lost the best presidential candidate that would have been produced.”
Girei also said ‘in politics of today, it is very clear that the highest bidders always have their way and the election goes to not necessarily the best, but those who could buy their way in a cash-and-carry manner.”
