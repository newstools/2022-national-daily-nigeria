A few minutes ago, renowned Human Rights Activist, Aisha Yesufu took to her Twitter handle to lament how a representative of a loan company called to inform her that someone she did not know used her as a guarantor while assessing a loan from the establishment.
She then went on to say that the same representative repeated the call the following day insisting that she informs the debtor to repay the loan since she (Yesufu) was picked as guarantor.
Aisha disclosed that while expressing her surprise at being picked as a guarantor for a loan application without her knowledge, the company representative lectured and berated her for asking such a question.
“Yesterday I got a call from someone telling me about someone I don’t know putting my number down as a guarantor on their loan app. Today again, I asked how do you give a loan without contacting the so Called guarantor.
The guy gave me a lecture and berated me. Trouble dey sleep!” She lamented.

As expected, Aisha Yesufu’s remarks drew the attention of many of her followers who took to the comment section to react.
While some persons chose to offer explanations on how loan companies operate, others, however, shared similar experiences.
