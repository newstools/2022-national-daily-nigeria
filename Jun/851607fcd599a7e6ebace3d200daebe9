The deputy governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Rivers State, Tonto Dikeh, has indicated her readiness for the race in the 2023 general elections. She stated that she has been working on the governorship project in the past three years. Tonto Dikeh maintained that she is prepared for criticisms, and all forms of counter, activities against her.
Tonto Dikeh had highlighted in a media interaction on Sunday: “I am prepared for anything, truthfully. I have had three years to work on this, it’s not something that I just came out or emerged with. We have had a lot of time to work on this and for this. Criticism, I am ready, non-criticism I am ready. So, it doesn’t matter where the questions are coming from.
“I have failed in my life and I’m not denying that. Everyone has seen that.
“But am I going to fail with leadership. Have I failed in leadership? Start from motherhood, have I ever failed in motherhood, talk about my foundation.
“I think it was one of the foundations that stood up for this country, in the time of the pandemic, with no assistance whatsoever. I did even more than the government.”
Tonto DIkeh was nominated deputy governorship candidate by the governorship candidate of the ADC in Rivers State, Tonte Ibraye, for the 2023 elections.
Tonto DIkeh had acknowledged her nomination last Friday, writing on her social media handles: “I thank Mr. Tonte Ibraye (@TonteIbraye), the Governorship candidate for ADC, Rivers State, for nominating me as his running mate.
“We are looking at investing in social protection, creating social value system & increased women’s inclusion in governance.”
Tonte Ibraye and Tonto Dikeh received their Certificates of Return from the ADC party chairman, Ralph Okey Nwosu, last Friday in Abuja.
