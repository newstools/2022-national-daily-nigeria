Reno Omokri, a popular author and human rights activist, and Deji Adeyanju have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the recent development on the Zamfara-Sokoto road, where gunmen allegedly abducted 50 wedding guests.
According to the report, armed bandits abducted no fewer than 50 wedding guests travelling along the Sokoto-Zamfara road. Those abducted include telephone marketers at the popular Bebeji Plaza in Gusau.
As regards this, Reno noted that the security system under APC rulership has totally collapsed. Speaking through his official Twitter handle, he said, “These so-called bandits, who are in reality just terrorists, are way more in control than the Buhari administration.” They have now kidnapped 50 wedding guests in Sokoto. APC has lost control of Nigerians to them!”
Deji, who knows quite well that this is not the first time something like this has happened, pointed out that these same people who cannot conquer terrorism will still strive to fall into power again. Speaking through his official Twitter handle, he said, “JUST IN: Terrorists invade Benue community, kill 11 after abduction of 50 wedding guests in Zamfara.” The APC folks will want you to vote them in again so they can continue from where Buhari stopped. “Dear esteemed readers, what is your opinion concerning this?
