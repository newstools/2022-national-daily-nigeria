Buhari begged the APC governors to allow him pick his successor.
The governors however resisted, especially as it became clear party chairman Abdullahi Adamu was pushing Sen. President Ahmed Lawan.
But speaking on Channels TV days later, El-Rufai said Buhari rejected the suggestion to anoint a candidate.
“I went to Mr President [Muhammadu Buhari] and asked him ‘have you decided who we should vote for?’ And he said, ‘I told you, go and vote for any of the five’,” El-Rufai said.
“And I said, ‘Mr. President, Kaduna delegates are your delegates, you’re going to retire and live in Kaduna. So you can tell me who you want out of the five?’
“And Mr. President said ‘I want all five, let the delegates choose. Tell them to vote their conscience. They’re representing 10 million people of Kaduna State. It is their responsibility. So let them discharge it and choose the right candidate.”
The delegates across the nation eventually voted for the party’s National Leader Bola Tinubu.
