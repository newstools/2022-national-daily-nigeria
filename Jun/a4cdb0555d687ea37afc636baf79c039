Reno Omokri, the special assistant to the former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has taken to social media to speak about the history of Tinubu while sitting as the Governor of Lagos State. Reno pointed out that Tinubu is not someone that can easily be worked with because he is difficult.
The well-known author also noted that Tinubu quarrelled with two of his deputies and that this made them leave the office. It can be recalled that Mrs Kofoworola Bucknor had an uneasy relationship with the former Lagos State Governor, and she couldn’t help but resign. However, Femi Pedro was also accused of collaborating with outsiders to bring the PDP into power, and he was removed.
In this regard, Reno noted that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the only Governor in the Fourth Republic to have done so. Speaking through his official Twitter handle, he said, “People do not realise how difficult it is to work with Tinubu.” He is the ONLY Governor in the Fourth Republic who had a falling out with and removed TWO of his deputy Governors. He fell out with Kofoworola Bucknor, replaced her with Femi Pedro, and still fell out with Pedro! ”

Reno Omokri’s main reason for bringing all of this up about the APC flag bearer could be because he is running for President.
