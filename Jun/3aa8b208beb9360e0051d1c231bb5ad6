He revealed this in Ilorin, Kwara state on the sidelines of a reception organised for him by his club, the Rotary International Clubs.
“Every kilometre of the 12,000 I covered was fraught with challenges, pains and difficulties.
“ Several times I came close to dying. I actually saw death several times. When people say the saw death I never believed that but when I saw that like four times in Sahara and Mali I now believe that death exists.
“God just wants to keep me alive that is why death did not take me. But one thing I said to myself was that whatever it took I would not quit.”
The Offa- born biker defied all the odds to achieve two purposes: raising awareness of the “End-polio message”.
“The second objective was to raise fund. For me the two had been accomplished because everybody is now aware of polio. Polio has got a renewed drive as we have the vaccines to end the virus, he said.
“I am very happy that the message has taken a global dimension.
“The London-Lagos ride covered a total of 12,000 kilometres spanning through 13 countries and 41 cities.
“I Left London April 19th and arrived Lagos on My 29th.”
The president of the Rotary Clubs in the state, Otunba Rich Oladele, said that the bike rider has done the state and in deed Nigeria proud.
“He has written the name of Nigeria on global map and in the Guinness Book of Records. He is a member of Rotary Club International.”
