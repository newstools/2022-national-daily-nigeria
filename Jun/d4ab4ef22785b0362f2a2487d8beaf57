With three days left before the deadline for the submission of names of candidates and their running mate to the Independent National Electoral Commission, no presidential candidates has nominated his running mate.
While Asiwaju Tinubu is still considering the possibility of picking a Muslim running mate, Atiku Abubakar on the other hand has about seven southern governors including Ifeanyi Okowa, Nyesom Wike and others to select from.
Speaking during today’s edition of journalists hangout on TVC, popular Nigerian broadcaster and multiple awards winning journalist, Babajide Otitoju has said that Asiwaju Tinubu has found himself in a more complicated situation.
When asked on who he thinks would help Asiwaju Tinubu win the election, Babajide mentioned the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum and Kaduna state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai.
According to Babajide Otitoju, Zulum has a large following in the north. He stated that Zulum has performed well as governor and could play a vital role in Asiwaju bid to win. However Babajide Otitoju said he is not sure Zulum would accept the offer.
On Nasir El-Rufai, Babajide Otitoju said the governor is a technocrat that can compliment Asiwaju Tinubu presidential ambition.
