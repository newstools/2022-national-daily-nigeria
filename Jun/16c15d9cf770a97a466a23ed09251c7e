The strategic alliance will also include other members.
Spearheading the move is SWAGA’s deputy national chairman Adesoji Akanbi who told the Punch in an interview.
“What we are trying to do with the coalition is that a lot of people are angry with their parties, maybe due to fraudulent primaries, and they moved to other parties. We are trying to target such individuals too, not parties alone,” he said.
“They are even our main target. They left the APC maybe because their governors caused it. We are trying to pacify them to contest for any position in any other party but they should work with us; they should support Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
“We are not asking them to support all the APC candidates because they are now on another platform. Instead of wasting the votes and their efforts on presidential candidates (of their new parties) that they have no prior relationship with, why can’t they work with us?”
