Renowned human rights activist and Convener of Concerned Nigerians, Comrade Deji Adeyanju has vowed to criticize further the Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi if he makes more blunders. Recall that there were widespread criticisms after Peter Obi declared days ago that he has jetted off to Egypt to understudy the Egyptian Power Sector, Education, Planning and Finance Sectors of the country.
Some sections of Nigerians online, including Deji Adeyanju attacked him for traveling out of the country instead of going to Ekiti to help the Gubernatorial candidate of the Labour Party in the State with their campaign for the June 18th Ekiti State election. However, Doyin Okupe, Peter Obi’s campaign manager responded by saying that Peter Obi’s trip has been scheduled long before the party’s primaries.
While responding to the attack directed at him and others who do not support Peter Obi by Peter Obi supporters, Deji Adeyanju stated that Peter Obi would be criticized because he is not a god. Speaking further, he made it known that he criticized him for going to Egypt instead of Ekiti, adding that he would continue to criticize him if he makes more blunders. “We criticized APC, Buhari, and PDP, Peter Obi won’t be an exception”, he concluded.
