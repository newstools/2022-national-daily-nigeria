Manchester United fans and their new team boss Erik ten Hag have eagerly waited for a transfer breakthrough at Old Trafford after the arrival of the Dutchman.
Meanwhile, the wait could be over after Ten Hag is about to add 22-year-old Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord to his squad ahead of the new season but reports have suggested United were prioritising a deal for Frenkie de Jong before moving onto other targets.
Malacia is also wanted by New Castle and Lyon with the Ligue 1 side agreeing a fee of €15million with Feyenoord.
A deal to take the Netherlands international to France was thought to be all but completed but United are now close to hijacking that deal.
National Daily gathered from the report by Voetbal International that Feyenoord also agreed a deal with the Premier League side on Monday night. The decision is now down to Malacia to choose between United and Lyon.
Malacia also shares an agent with de Jong, who United are hopeful of signing in the coming weeks.
United are thought to be close to agreeing a £68million deal with Barcelona with ten Hag making the Netherlands midfielder his top target this summer.
Malacia meanwhile is said to fit the bill in what ten Hag is looking for in his United squad – young, hungry players who are eager to impress.
Ten Hag tried to sign the Netherlands international for Ajax last summer but the intense rivalry between the Amsterdam club and Feyenoord meant no deal could be done.
United had hoped to sing another Dutchman in Ajax star Jurrien Timber this summer, with the United boss identifying the 21-year-old as a ‘future captain’.
The versatile defender however appears ready to reject United’s advances and remain at Ajax for at least one more season.
