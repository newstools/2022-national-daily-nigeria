It was alleged that Igbokwe, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was physically assaulted by Yoruba youths.


Joe Igbokwe has reacted to a report circulating online that he was attacked by Yoruba youths who also burnt his car.
The report claimed that the youths attacked Igbokwe while asking him to leave their state.
Igbokwe is the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Government on Environmental Cleansing and Protection.
Reacting on Wednesday, Igbokwe said nothing of such happened.
According to Igbokwe, the report “is a lie from the pit of hell”.
“Please ignore the Fake News flying about since Monday that Yoruba youths attacked me in Lagos and burnt my vehicles. It is a lie from the pit of hell. Lies cannot win a debate anywhere. South West is not South East!!!” he wrote on his known Facebook account.
