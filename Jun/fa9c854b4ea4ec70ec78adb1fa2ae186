Prof. Onor  said the opposition feared Tinubu as a candidate will give the PDP a lot of problem.
“The emergence of the former Lagos State Governor, Alhaji Bola Tinubu, was what we did not expect. We did not want that to happen.”
The PDP and many Nigeria had believed V.P. Yemi Osinbajo would win the primary, and the general election could have been a walkover for Atiku. But Osinbajo nearly bottomed out among the four leading contestants.
Onor, however, said with former vice president as its candidate, the PDP will dislodge the ruling APC.
In the lead-up to the APC primary, Tinubu had called Atiku to congratulate him on his victory as the PDP candidate, saying the former vice president would be a worthy adversary.
