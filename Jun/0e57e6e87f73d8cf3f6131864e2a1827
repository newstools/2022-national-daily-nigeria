The duty of the Nigerian military is to protect the nation against all enemies both domestic and foreign but, the military alone cannot do the job.

This is why former Nigerian Chief Of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (rtd), while speaking as a guest lecturer at a program organised by Arewa House in Kaduna on Saturday, called for dialogue between the government and armed groups, saying one-third of the fight against insecurity is military while others should be non-kinetic through dialogue.
As expected, many Nigerians who came across the report released by Punch Newspaper, reacted angrily wondering why he didn’t adopt that method while he was chief of Army staff. Others also kicked against his advice.
A Nigerian with the username, Yetunde Sonaike blasted Buratai saying; “This man who used to hold the highest position in the army does not know that you don’t negotiate with terrorists. Terrorists must be defeated and when you negotiate after defeat, you will have an upper hand”.Many others blasted the former Army chief who is now Nigeria’s Ambassador to Benin Republic. To them, dialogue is not the way out.
