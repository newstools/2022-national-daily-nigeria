No fewer than two policemen were on Thursday feared killed by gunmen who were said to have attacked a checkpoint at the Garki area of Enugu State capital.
Sources said there was heavy shooting at the popular MTD junction in Akwuke, as the operatives engaged the gunmen in a shootout.
Details of the attack which happened at about 10.30am on Thursday were still sketchy as of the time of this report.
But, sources said that the sound of the gunshots caused panic in the area as motorists parked their vehicles and took refuge inside the Gariki Park.

One of them said on the telephone, “As I’m talking to you, they are still shooting. What we heard initially was that two policemen were killed. But I think the policemen are still returning firepower that’s why we’re still hearing the sound of gunshots by now.
“It is only someone who passed through that place that can say exactly what happened. Currently, everybody has run into the park for safety”.
Efforts to get police confirmation failed as the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Daniel Ndukwe did not respond to calls and messages by our reporter.
