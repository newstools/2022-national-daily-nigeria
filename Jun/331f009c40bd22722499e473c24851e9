Nigeria media personality, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has in a live video on his verified Facebook account a few minutes ago, sent a strong message to Peter Obi about what he must do towards the 2023 election.
Prior to the message Daddy Freeze sent to Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate about what he must do towards the 2023 general election, he disclosed that Peter Obi is his preferred presidential candidate and he would like to commend Peter Obi for his Ibadan rally, which he did in the early hours of Saturday.
According to Daddy Freeze in the message he sent to Peter Obi, he said Peter Obi’s vice must be a Muslim from the north; that is, his vice must be a Muslim and also a northerner. He said it is extremely important for the optics of his party.
He also advises Peter Obi of the need to permeate and penetrate the south-west. He observes that even though the west is going to be tough for Peter Obi to penetrate because Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the APC candidate, is from the west, yet, he has to do something about it.
Daddy Freeze finally suggested to Peter Obi that he should start meeting with Yoruba kings like “Ooni of Ife” or send delegates to all first-class kings and kingmakers in the west to give him a better chance in the west. He added that Peter Obi needs to start forming alliances with powerful Yoruba forces to aid his chance of winning in the west.
