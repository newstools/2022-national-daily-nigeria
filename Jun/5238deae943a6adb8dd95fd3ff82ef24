Former Senator of Kaduna Central, Senator Shehu Sani has taken to his official Twitter handle hours ago to call for order in the Southern part of Nigeria after suspected Bandits were said to have attacked St. Francis Catholic Church at Owaluwa Owo, Ondo State. About 50 Worshippers were reportedly shot dead by the assailants, while many others were rushed to the hospital after sustaining several levels of injuries.
While reacting to the incident, former Senator Shehu Sani stated that this same terrorist attack is also happening in the North, adding that the perpetrators intend to trigger vendetta and national strife. Speaking further, he made it known that these terrorists do not spare worshippers in the Church or the Mosque, adding that the North has been a daily show for their heinous activities. He, however, advised Southerners not to molest or attack Northerners living in the South due to the activities of these terrorists.
