The Imo State Government, on Wednesday debunked reports insinuating that Governor Hope Uzodinma encountered a stroke and was flown to India for medical attention. The state government described the reports as unfounded, wicked, and mindless, condemning a recorded voice message circulating on social media on the false report.
The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, in a statement on Wednesday dismissed the voice message received in Owerri, Imo State, on Wednesday, insisting that Uzodinma is healthy and has been attending to all scheduled official activities in Abuja.
The Information Commissioner asserted that Governor Uzodinma is not afflicted with any challenge that would have led to a stroke. He protested that the people spreading the fake news are Lucifer’s descendants wishing the governor harm in vain.
Emelumba urged the people disseminating the false information to stop immediately or face unmitigated disaster.
“Those who do not wish the governor well have been fantasizing about a phantom illness, but they will continue to be disappointed because Uzodinma is in good health and is attending to state duties.”
The Commissioner appealed to Nigerians and Imo residents to ignore “this fabrication from mentally deranged elements seeking attention over nothing.”
Emelumba emphasized that the false report had been communicated to the appropriate security agencies for investigation and tracking the people spreading  the satanic audio recording.
