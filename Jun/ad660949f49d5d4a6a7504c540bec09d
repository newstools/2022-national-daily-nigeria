Former Presidential Aide, Reno Omokri, has reacted after Nollywood Actress Tonto Dikeh described him as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s houseboy and bingo.
Recall that Omokri, in a Facebook post, took a swipe at Bola Ahmed Tinubu over his statement on facilitating President Buhari’s win in the last presidential election.
The human rights activist likened Tinubu’s action to Actress Nkechi Blessing and Tonto Dikeh, who he cited as examples of disgruntled lovers.
Angered by his statement, Tonto dragged Omokri, describing him as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar’s houseboy and ‘bingo’ who is always ‘fingering’ on Twitter from exile.
In a recent post, Reno addressed the comment of a troll who called his attention to Tonto Dikeh’s post about him.
The troll wrote;
“Someone said you’re the houseboy of Atiku”
Omokri accepted the ‘houseboy’ moniker, saying he prefers to serve than be in a position where God has not placed him.
He wrote;
“Thank you for your comment. I am a houseboy? Okay. Are houseboys not human beings? We will all die one day, and in death, we are equal. Joseph was Potiphar’s houseboy, and through that he ruled Egypt. Daniel was Nebuchadnezzar’s houseboy, and from there he governed Babylon.
“Being a houseboy is not an insult. At least it is better to serve as a houseboy and wait for God to promote you in His own time than to want for be where God has not put you. l am currently chilling in The Bahamas. It is the 18th country i have visited this year. If as a houseboy, I can maintain such a lifestyle, then it can’t be so bad! Thank you again and may God bless you. #TableShaker”
