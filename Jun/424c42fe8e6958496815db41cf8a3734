Islamic group, Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has alleged that there is presence of Boko Haram terrorists in the South West.
The group which strongly condemned the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church Owo, alleged that the attack was carried out by Boko Haram terrorists and that more worship places may come under such attack.
MURIC in a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola said, “We strongly condemn this act of unprovoked aggression. It is inhuman, heinous, horrific and horrendous.

“We call for immediate arrest and prosecution of the attackers. This latest attack is indubitable evidence of the existence of Boko Haram in the South West after their penetration into Niger and Kogi States,” the group said.
“Going by Boko Haram modus operandi, we warn that mosques and more churches may be the next targets because this was how they started in the North. We, therefore, ask for protection for all churches and mosques in the region,” it said.
The group called on the Nigeria Police Force to move into action and find the killers of the evil act.
The group also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately send the Nigeria Army to the state to hunt for the killers.
