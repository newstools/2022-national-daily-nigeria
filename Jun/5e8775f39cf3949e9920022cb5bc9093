As Nigeria comes to grip with the recent brutal attack on Christian worshippers by armed terrorists in Owo, a video showing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his way to the scene of the killings has surfaced on social media.
In the footage, the self-styled All Progressives National Leader and presidential aspirant, could be seen inside a bus which was said to be heading to Owo town. He was seen in the company of Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu.
As expected, the video has drawn mixed reactions on social media.
Sharing the clip on his Twitter handle, former presidential aide, Reno Omokri commended the former Lagos Governor for choosing to visit the crime scene as quickly as possible.
According to Mr.Omokri, Asiwaju’s actions were indicative of good leadership.
He, however, urged the Asiwaju to donate some money toward procuring much-needed pints of blood for the victims of the attack, adding that the APC leader had the financial muscle to do so.

Recall that no fewer than 50 persons were gunned down by armed assailants who attacked Saint Francis Catholic Church at Owo Town, in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State on Sunday.
The terrorists, who allegedly disguised themselves as Christian worshippers, were said to have opened fire on hundreds of innocent civilians in the church, among whom were pregnant women and children.
Eyewitnesses also revealed that the assailants made use of bombs believed to be Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) to begin the attack before resorting to the use of guns.
