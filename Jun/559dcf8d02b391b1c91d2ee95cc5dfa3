As the preparation for the Ekiti guber election heightens, and the Labor Party which merged with the ruling APC two weeks ago, works to ensure the APC succeeds, LP’s presidential candidate Peter Obi is not there for the party.
Peter Obi defected to the LP when his chances of getting the PDP presidential ticket became impossible. His new party gave him the ticket for the asking, though Prof. Pat Utomi was already in the race.
While Obi’s Twitter followers are excited and making a point of voters getting armed with their permanent voters card to dislodge the APC and the PDP, it appears their candidate has no connection to the party’s grassroots.
Otherwise, many say, he should have been in Ekiti championing the course of the LP candidate Olugbenga Daramola for the state’s guber election coming up June 18.
While the APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu has gone there to campaign for the party’s candidate Abayomi Oyebanji, Obi is already airborne on his to Egypt—for a study tour of Cairo’s energy and financial sectors.
His study tour is coming about six months to the presidential election, and about the time he should be familiarizing with his new party, especially its grassroots structure across the nation.
Like all carpetbaggers, Obi is planning to parachute in and win the 2023 presidential election without any spadework in an environment where all politics is local.
