Apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has reacted to comments the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Fr. Ejike Mbaka made about presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi.



Recall Mbaka triggered outrage after calling Peter Obi a “stingy man” and also saying that he won’t become President until he kneels before his ministry.



Reacting to this, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, said Mbaka should go and sin no more. He also appealed to Obi to forgive him, adding that the cleric needs prayers, psychological and spiritual assistance to bounce back.



The statement read;


“Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has praised the Enugu Diocese of Catholic Church, led by Bishop Onaga for the prompt disclaimer to the inflammatory and unwarranted assault on the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, and a Catholic brethren, Mr. Peter Obi.



“We were not surprised that Fr. Mbaka acted as a machinery of doom paid by a South-East Governor to sow seeds of discord in attempting to halt a celebrity status of Mr. Peter Obi and his National acceptance as a unifying Presidential candidate for Nigerians.



“Mbaka is human bound to make blunders and needs our prayers, psychological and spiritual assistance to bounce back, and we know that the Enugu Diocese of Catholic Church has cautioned him privately to refrain from political pronouncements.



“Go and sin no more Fr. Mbaka. We implore Mr. Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s Presidential candidate, to find a way to forgive Mbaka. To err is human, and to forgive is divine.



“Nigerians are watching keenly and waiting patiently for more paid agents from Southeastern Nigeria hired to do the campaign of calumny against the new Nigeria’s movement, ‘Take Back Nigeria Mantra’, led by the millions of Nigerians for Mr. Peter Obi.”
