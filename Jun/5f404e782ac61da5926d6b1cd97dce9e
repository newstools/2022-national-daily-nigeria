Share this on WhatsAppSpread the loveLP’s presidential candidate Peter Obi recent statement criticizing President Muhammadu Buhari for investing in infrastructure instead of education and SME has drawn a backlash.
An APC operative in Lagos, Joe Igbokwe, hit back at Obi for such remark, calling him a mere trader.
In his Facebook post, Igbokwe wrote: “Somebody who wants to be the President of Nigeria is telling you that infrastructure does not drive the economy in the 21st Century and you are taking that person seriously. Peter [Obi] is overrated in Nigeria. He is just a trader.
“Obiano built the Anambra International Airport, built the Awka flyover bridge. Which one did Mr Obi build in 8 years?
But Obi believes you can’t use infrastructure to drive economic growth.
“You invest in education and the SME (Small, Medium Enterprises) sector instead to deal with poverty,” the former governor said.
