The vigilante man, according to reports, wanted to arrest some residents loafing around the market.
The back-and forth between him and the resident eventually led to an exchange the Muslim youth considered blasphemous.
He was said to have made the comment when they pleaded with him in the “name of Allah”.
The security man was thereafter mobbed, stoned to death, and set ablaze.
That is the second instance of jungle justice some by some Muslim youths in about four weeks.
Deborah Samuel, a female student of tertiary institution in Sokoto was murdered in a similar manner for alleged blasphemy on campus.
When contacted, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh confirmed the Abuja incident.
President Muhammadu Buhari has yet to speak on the alleged killing in the seat of power.
It took him a while before he spoke on the Sokoto killing, though he condemned it as criminal.
