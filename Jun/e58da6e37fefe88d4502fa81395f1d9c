APC national chairman Abdullahi Adamu has revealed the party position on the comment the party national leader Bola Tinubu made about President Muhammadu Buhari in Abeokuta.
Tinbu said he led the effort to bring Buhari to office in 2015, recapping the series of failure Buhari had before he encouraged the old general to try again.
“We may punish him (Tinubu) for his utterances against the President,” Adamu said while briefing journalists in Abuja on Saturday.
“He (Tinubu) went as far as saying how Gen. Muhammadu Buhari went to him, citing instances of even prostrating in tears begging him to endorse him and to support him for the presidency. He claimed Buhari went to him.
“Though he is the president, he belongs to everybody. It is amazing how a fellow APC person would make that kind of comment in that kind of circumstances about the president. We take exception to this. It has shown that he does not show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr President.
“Therefore we want to make it public that we are saddened by what we saw in the video, in that reportàge and we condemn it in the strongest of terms.
“We do hope that he would never say that kind of again, particularly of the APC extraction to make such kinds of comments.
“Yes, yesterday we saw some part of a retraction but that effort is not adequate. It is not sincere. It is not in-depth enough. It doesn’t wipe out the impression that that event has left in our minds.”
