This is coming few days after another South-West Group, Afenifere led by an Elder Statesman, Chief Ayo Adebanjo openly declared that it ‘ll not support Tinubu’s Presidential Ambition because it is the turn of the South-East to produce Nigeria’s Next President putting into consideration fairness, equity and justice. 
Adebanjo also stated that the South-West has produced Ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and the Incumbent Vice-president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo while the South-East is yet to occupy any of the Two Positions since 1999.
