Adamu Garba has told suspended police officer Abba Kyari to stop blaming the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra or its security outfit, the Eastern Security Network for his ordeal.


Abba Kyari told a panel set up to investigate him over his alleged ties to disgraced fraudster, Ramon Olorunwa Abass, aka‘Hushpuppi, that IPOB was out to destroy him.


He told the panel that the allegations against him were being propagated by members of the group and the Eastern Security Network, ESN because of his onslaught against them in the South-East.


Reacting to the development via a statement on his Facebook Page, Garba criticised the former top cop.


Garba wrote: “Abba Kyari should Stop blaming IPOB or ESN even though we know who they are, but he should carry his cross because he acted as a common criminal and should be treated like one.”





Abba, who was suspended by the police last July for his alleged links to Internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, is in the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for alleged drug dealing.
