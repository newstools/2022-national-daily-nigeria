Kannywood actress, Sadiya Haruna, has been sentenced to six months in prison for defaming another actor, Isa A. Isa
The court sitting at Malam Aminu Kano International Airport handed Haruna six months imprisonment without the option of a fine for defaming a colleague, actor Isa A. Isa.
The presiding judge, Justice Muntari Dandago, while reading his judgement, said he found the actress guilty on all counts against her.
Haruna had in a viral video, accused Isa of being a homosexual, a bastard and an unrepentant womaniser.
She alleged that the actor, Isa, demanded anal sex from her in the viral Instagram post.
The judge further ruled that in case Haruna continued to defame Isa, she would be sentenced to three years in prison.
He said the actress had up to three months to appeal the judgment.
In August 2021, a Sharia court sitting in Kano state convicted her of obscenity and indecent acts.
In 2019, Haruna had accused Isa of initiating her into “short term marriage”, while she continued to share his videos on her Instagram page.
He, however, denied the allegation and dragged her before the court for alleged character assassination.
