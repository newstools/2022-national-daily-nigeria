Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero recently treated fans to a glimpse of his life after retirement as he went out fishing with a group of friends.
National Daily reports Aguero who was forced into retirement because of a heart issue, shared some interesting snaps of himself clad in expensive designer wear while on his fishing expedition.
The Argentine was clad in a swanky-looking pair of £265 Versace swim shorts.
To complete his look, the Man City legend had white sandals and a red top and a funny-looking straw hat to help him keep away from the scorching sun.

For the fishing trip, Aguero decided to go to Esquina in the Argentinian province of Corrientes – the birth place of the late Diego Maradona’s parents.
In the photos and videos shared on his Instagram, Aguero seems to not have a care in the world as he enjoys the day out with his friends.
At some point, the 33-year old jibes at his friend by telling him “1-0”, before kissing the fish he seemingly caught.
In his caption, he wrote: “Enjoying with friends in Esquina in Corrientes. Incredible sports fishing experience.”
Since making a teary goodbye to the game of football in December, Aguero has been holidaying in Uruguay and Argentina.
The 33-year old, who is Manchester City’s all-time top goalscorer, returned to his homeland three days after confirming he was quitting football.
He has also taken a surprise interest in a different sport since his retirement – tennis, but not on a professional level.
Aguero’s social media engagement also seems to have spiked since quitting the game, with fans seemingly interested to see his next move. While he is yet to reveal his next plans, Aguero has been awarded an ambassadorial role at Manchester City.
