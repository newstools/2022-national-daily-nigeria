The Lagos State government has commenced the demolition of the State High Court, Igbosere, after about 16 months of fire outbreak.
The court was invaded during the mob action of #EndSARS protest in October 2020 in Lagos State and other parts of the country.
The Supreme Court of Nigeria was located at the building before it was relocated to Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
The gates of the court were seen locked by officials of the state government during the demolition.
