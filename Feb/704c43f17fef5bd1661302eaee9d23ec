The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) after a meeting of the 19 APC governors and President Muhammadu Bahari at the State House, Abuja, zoned the national chairman of the party to the north central, and released detailed timetable for the party’s national convention on March 26.
Governors Nasiru El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, in a media interaction at the State House, after the meeting of the governors with President Muhammadu Buhari, affirmed that APC has resolved to alternate positions in the National Working Committee (NWC) held in the past years by the South with those held by  North during the election at the national convention on March 26.
El-Rufai highlighted: “We have agreed a zoning formula for all the six geopolitical zones and essentially, we swapped. Northern zones will take positions that Southern zones had in the last eight years and vice versa.
“So, it’s a very simple, equitable and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation will start in earnest. So, by the grace of God on the 26th of March, we will have done a national convention.”
The meeting President Buhari was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the governors of Yobe, Kano, Kogi, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Kwara, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Lagos, Imo, Ogun, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Plateau, including the Deputy Governor of Anambra State.
