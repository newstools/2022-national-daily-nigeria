A man spotted in a viral video recently, brushing his teeth while waiting in a long queue for fuel, has generated mixed reactions among many Nigerians.
Are the days of sleeping overnight on a long queue finally back or is this just a coincidence?
Following the rise in the cost of Premium Motor Spirit (Petrol) which according to reports, was as a result of the import of millions of dirty fuel from Europe into Nigeria, the fuel supply system in the country has since been affected. The scarcity of fuel, which has been occurring for almost a week, has now resulted in many waiting in a long queue at the respective filling stations in the country.
Reacting to the video which was posted online, many had asked why Nigeria cannot build its refinery to make use of, while some had complained of experiencing the same thing the man in the video had just experienced.
However, what is generating more anxieties among some Nigerians now is whether our country is about getting back to the old days of waiting in a long queue at the filling stations.
Recall, there have been instances where some people had to keep sleeping and waking at the filling stations for up to 3 days or more to get fuel. Some were even going to their offices and resuming back at the stations instead of going straight to their homes. 
See a few reactions from some Nigerians to the video, below.
For how long do we expect the current situation of the high cost of fuel and its scarcity to persist?
