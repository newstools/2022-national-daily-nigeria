She was said to have lied to her lover, Jamilu Suleiman, who was the father of the baby that the baby died.
Yakubu and a nurse, Esther Romanus, were remanded in prison by the Chief Magistrate Court in Yola, the state capital, for alleged criminal conspiracy, buying or selling of persons for immoral purposes.

When they were arraigned on Monday, Yakubu pleaded guilty while Romanus denied being part of the deal.
The police prosecutor, Sergeant Sawe Nicholas, told the court that the father of the child reported the matter to the police on February 2.
He said Suleiman told the police that his fiancee had disappeared with their baby to an unknown destination only to tell him on returning that the child had died.
The police prosecutor added that the investigation led to the discovery of the said missing child.
