Ahead of the 2023 general election, former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan’s (GEJ) defection to All Progressives Congress and presidential bid rumours has become the cynosure of the media.
There is a popular saying that “there is no smoke without fire”. Jonathan’s failure to attend the Peoples Democratic Party’s last national convention and other activities organized by the party in recent times, as well as his frequent visit to Aso Rock, fuelled the rumours that he was considering a move to the ruling APC when asked in an interview with journalists if Jonathan is still a member of the main opposition party, Sule Lamido, a PDP stalwart and former governor of Jigawa State said “I doubt it, he has not been attending recent activities of our party”.

In a recent encounter with the Nations newspaper correspondent at a meeting organized by Economic Community For West Africa States (ECOWAS) in Lagos State, Jonathan had the opportunity to end the widespread speculation that he was nursing a 2023 presidential ambition, however, the former president’s action only fanned the speculation.
The Nations newspaper reported that when asked about his thoughts on the 2023 general elections and whether he planned to contest for the presidency as rumoured, Jonathan skillfully avoided the second question and answered the first. Jonathan expressed optimism that the coming general elections will be credible and Nigerians had no reason to worry over it.
Politicians are usually quick to debunk rumours about them that hold no element of truth. When asked about his rumoured presidential ambition in an interview with BBC, We saw how Nasir El-Rufai the governor of Kaduna State was quick to dismiss the rumours, stating that at 62, the job of a president would be too difficult for him.

In my opinion, GEJ’s failure to dismiss the rumours of his presidential ambition is perhaps an indication that he is nursing a presidential ambition or that he is strongly considering running for presidency come 2023.
