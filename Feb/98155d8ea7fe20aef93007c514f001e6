Some few hours ago, there was news about the arrest of the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, Abba Kyari, by authorities of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency over alleged drug dealings.
This development has put the embattled Abba Kyari on the blacklist in the minds of many Nigerians who had always respected and celebrated the super cop with one of the highest awards and recognition in the Nigeria Police Force.
Joe Igbokwe, the special adviser to the Lagos State Governor on drainage and water resources, had shared and commented on the photo of Abba Kyari when receiving a standing ovation from the members of the House of Representatives for his effort in fighting Crimea in the country.Igbokwe stated that he did not know that someone could sacrifice such a great and unprecedented honour such as the one bestowed on Abba Kyari by the members of the House of Representatives for any amount of money.

What do you think about Abba Kyari and the several allegations that he has been facing recently? Remember, there is a previous case about his alleged involvement with Hushpuppi in an internet scam.
