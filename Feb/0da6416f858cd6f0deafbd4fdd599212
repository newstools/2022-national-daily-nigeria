The Arewa Summit International has given reasons why the North will not support the presidential ambition of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress and other candidates from the south.
The Director-General of the group, Dr. Bashir Lamido who disclosed this at the weekend in Yola, Adamawa State while addressing supporters, said the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu is the candidate of the North because of his nationalistic ideas.
Lamido, a chieftain of the APC also enjoined all other aspirants in the southern Nigerian and indeed, all parties to support Kalu.

“The North won’t support a regional candidate like Tinubu, Osinbajo, Umahi or Amaechi. It is about trust and who can truly defend Nigeria.
“In 2023, we won’t support any regional candidate; Kalu has what it takes to lead Nigeria. He knows Nigeria too well having been in close and brotherly relationship with the North in the past 38 years. We won’t support someone that would emerge and destabilize Nigeria.
“It is important they step down now and adopt Orji Kalu because the North won’t support them. Politics is a game of interest, and Orji Uzor Kalu is the interest of the North and millions of other Nigerians,” Lamido said.
