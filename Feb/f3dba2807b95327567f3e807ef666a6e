Oni moved jumped out of the APC when he could not secure the party ticket for the last guber election which produced APC Gov Kayode Fayemi.
“Ekiti people will not leave Oni alone to go like that because they can’t see any other person that can deliver what Oni has been doing for them,” a source told the Daily Post.
“So, it is the voice of the people and not the voice of anybody. As it is now, both PDP and APC will be contesting against the people of Ekiti. And the symbol of the people of Ekiti State is Engr. Oni,” Jackson said.
Another of his supporter described the PDP as a cult, and that Oni is a seeker of truth, a quest the makes him face persecution every now and then.
The PDP and the APC have concluded their primaries. Oni is in a strait as to which party will field him now.
