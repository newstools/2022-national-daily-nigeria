Nigerians are currently dragging Babajide Sanwo-Olu mercilessly on Twitter after his social handlers claimed he was “heartbroken” when he spotted two child hawkers on the streets of Lagos.
According to Gboyega Akosile: “Gov @jidesanwoolu today gave hope to two out-of-school girls he met on his way to an official duty this morning. The Gov was heartbroken to see the girls on the road during school hours, with buckets on their heads, stopped his convoy, inquired why they were not in school.”
The social handler continued: “They told him their parents couldn’t afford tuition fees. He found who their parents were and promised to take over the full responsibility of the girls’ upbringing and education.”

And here’s what Nigerians think of the strategically taken photos:

So? A campaign gimmick?
Embarasing. There is no monitoring facility to notify the state education board when children miss school.
We do not need a gov for this. There are so many out of school children. Not just these two.
Yet, Lagos is a Centre of excellence. What excellence?

This is a really commendable intervention by the Governor with the heart of gold. He just needs to find the remaining 2,378,792 out-of-school children roaming Lagos State and give them hope too. https://t.co/vEB3dP86lD
