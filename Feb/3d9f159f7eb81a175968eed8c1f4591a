Nigerian musician Folarin Falana popularly known as Falz has started campaigning to Nigerians ahead of the 2023 general election.
The popular rapper has started campaigning for citizens to get their permanent voters’ cards ready to vote in their ideal candidate in 2023.
Falz, a law graduate and an activist said this during a recent interview with HipTV.
According to him, “Everywhere is hot but I need our heads to also be hot. Saying we’ve faced so much injustice is an understatement.
“We’ve seen so much nonsense that the authorities haven’t owned up to. Up until now, there’s just been so much rubbish going on. And it has to come to an end.
“I think that everybody knows that right now more than ever. Everyone should register to vote. 2023 is literally here already. Before the deadline, which I think is June, everybody needs to go out there and register. It’s very easy. You can do your registration online. And of course, go ahead and get your PVC.”
When asked if he does not fear for his life, Falz said, “So, why would I fear for my life when the kind of life we are existing in is not even anything exciting.
“Basic amenities are unavailing. Every Nigerian is one small sickness away from either going broke or passing away.
“So, what kind of life is that? A life so fickle, so fragile, a life so unexciting. What’s there to be happy about? What’s there to fear for? That’s how I feel. That’s how I approach it.
“I’d rather die fighting for a cause than just walking on the road and get knocked down by a bike because there’s no proper traffic control. It’s as simple as that.”
Falz has been outspoken against the injustice meted out by the government on its citizens and would not rest till the right things are done
