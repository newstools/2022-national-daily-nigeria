After a breathtaking summer transfer window last year which saw the two greatest players of the modern era, Messi and Ronaldo switch sides, the January winter transfer window was business as usual as clubs continued the pattern of loan deals with mandatory or optional buyout clause and free transfers due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The January transfer window of the top-flight English league, the Premier League ended yesterday by 11pm while the transfer window is still open in other countries.
Relegation-threatened Newcastle United was the highest spender in the Premier League following the club’s acquisition by Saudi Arabian Consortium, making them the club with the richest owners in world football.
