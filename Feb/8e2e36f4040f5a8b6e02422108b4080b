As the 2023 election draws closer, different politicians have begun to make their intentions known about contesting the election after the tenure of President Buhari. One of those politicians who have declared their intentions is Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, the former Lagos governor and National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, APC.

There have been different mixed reactions to the aspiration of Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu after he declared his ambition to contest the 2023 presidency, as some Nigerians began to show him solidarity while others raised different allegations against him.
Joe Igbokwe shared a message attributed to Abayomi, a renowned legal practitioner and activist, where he stated that people should have been looking at not only the sins of Ahmed Tinubu but also some of his goodwill.The activists counter some of the points raised against Tinubu. One of the points he tried to clarify was the issue of the richness and prosperity of the former Lagos Governor. He made people understand that they shouldn’t have been expecting a man who made Lagos wealthy to be poor himself.
