The agency gave the assurance at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting at the State House on Thursday at the meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.
Nigerians have been writhing in pains unleashed by fuel scarcity for over about two weeks now.
This wasn’t the first time the NNPC would allay Nigerians’ fears.
Mele Kyari, the corporation group managing director, said some oil marketers imported adulterated fuel and the effort to check it led to the on-going scarcity.
A litre of petrol sells for N400, and up to N1000, in some states.
