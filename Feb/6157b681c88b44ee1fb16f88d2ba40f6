The former lawmaker who represented Kaduna Central senatorial district at the 8th National Assembly, Senator Shehu Sani, has opened up on the weaknesses of President Muhammadu Buhari.
According to him, the president lack of firmness in dealing with bandits and terrorist in the North-West was responsible for the boldness and audacity with which they operate.
While reacting to the killing of over 20 bandits by Nigerian troops while moving towards the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) on Friday, Sani said if Buhari had done the needful by designating the bandits as terrorists early enough and given them the kind of treatment terrorists are being given, they would not have still been operating with the kind of boldness they were exhibiting.

A statement by the Nigerian Army on Saturday had stated that the bandits, numbering over 100, and armed with sophisticated weapons, were sighted riding on motorcycles towards the premier military institution on Friday evening, but met their end when two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) helicopter gunships were dispatched to engage them.
While reacting to the news on his Twitter handle on Sunday, Sani said: “It’s commendable to receive the news that the military exterminated the terrorists advancing towards the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna.
“But it also demonstrated how daring the criminals are becoming and the danger we are currently facing in our city. Their boldness comes because the President and Commander in Chief refused to designate them as terrorists and give them the terrorist’s treatment.
“He was and is weak when it comes to bandits. Vigilance is the key.”
