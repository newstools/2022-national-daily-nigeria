A night stand in 1997 has gotten Cameroonian football legend Samuel Eto’o a daughter 22 years after.
And the revelation comes at a cost.
A Madrid court on Thursday said the Barcelona former striker fathered  Erika Do Rosario Nieves, a Spaniard.
Eto’o , now 40, did not attend the court proceeding since the woman filed the suit in 2018, but Fernando Osuna, who was in charge of the legal representation of Nieves’ lawsuit, has informed him.
Nieves’ mother and Eto’o met, according to the lawsuit, in a Madrid nightclub in 1997, when the Cameroon legend was on loan at Leganes.
The mother said she tried to communicate with the former Chelsea attacker about the pregnancy, but he did not answer her phone calls or emails.
She provided biological evidence that supported her testimony, which made the judge admit the claim.
The court ordered him pay Nieves 1,400 euros per month, starting from 2018.
