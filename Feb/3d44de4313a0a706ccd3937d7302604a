A group of four teenage girls who are said to be students of a secondary school in Lagos have been reportedly caught with human parts concealed inside their school bags for alleged money ritual.
According to reports, the young girls were discovered after a taxi driver who carried them raised an alarm that he perceived foul odour from his cab.
The driver is said to have handed the girls to the gateman of the school and when their school bags were checked, human heads were found inside.
Law enforcement officers reportedly swung into action and the girls were arrested.
The incident is coming at a time when the prevalence of ritual killing among youths is in the limelight.
Only a few weeks back, National Dailly reports about a uproar when four teenagers in Ogun State were caught in the act performing money ritual after they had beheaded the girlfriend of one of the members of the gang.
The young boys who claimed they had gotten the procedures for the ritual via Facebook were burning the young girl’s head in a pot when they were caught.
Similarly, two minors, both aged 15 were caught in the act trying to use a 14-year-old girl for rituals in Bayelsa.
