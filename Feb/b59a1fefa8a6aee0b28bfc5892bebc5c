Former senator, author, and human rights activistst, Shehu Sani has taken to his verified Twitter handler to react to the sanction on Russia’s President.
Recall that President Vladimir Putin was sanctioned for deploying military forces into breakaway regions of Ukraine to what he termed as peacekeeping. His action was seen as being illegal and could ruin peace negotiations.
However, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Japan have all imposed sanctions on Russia for ordering troops into the breakaway regions of Eastern Ukraine.
While reacting to this, Shehu Sani said how could the sanctions break Russia? He said that the sanctions did not break Iran for 42 years and it didn’t break Cuba too for 52 years.
In his tweet, Shehu wrote:
“So, the Sanctions that didn’t Break Iran for 42 years and that didn’t Break Cuba for 52 years will break Russia?”
