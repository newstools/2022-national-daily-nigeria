A few hours ago, the former Spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter, Joe Igbokwe, took to his social media page and reacted after Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso formed a new political party called The National Movement (TNM) as he says, “The men that destroyed Nigeria yesterday are on the march again”
It was gathered that the former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, is said to have launched a new political party called The National Movement (TNM), which aim is to rescue Nigeria.
Reacting, to the report, Joe Igbokwe said that the intention of the newly formed political party by Kwankwaso is to rescue Nigerians from PDP and APC. Joe Igbokwe, however, listed the names of former Governors who were present at the launch of the new political party as he alleged that the listed names are people that destroyed Nigeria some years ago.
Joe Igbokwe said that the former governors who are with The National Movement so far are;
1. His Excellency Rabiu Kwankwaso, Kano State.
2. His Excellency Captain Idris Wada, Kogi State.
3. His Excellency Lucky Ignedion, Edo State.
4. His Excellency Adamu Alero, Kebbi State
5. His Excellency Saminu Turaki, Jigawa State.
6. His Excellency Donald Duke of Cross Rivers State.
7. His Excellency Liyel Imoke, Cross River State.
8. His Excellency Abdulfatah Ahmed, Kwara State.
9. His Excellency Serika Dickson, Bayelsa State.
10. His Excellency Murtal Nyako, Adamawa State.
Do you think that the newly formed political party by Rabiu Kwankwaso and the support of other former governors can rescue and take Nigeria to a better height?
Do you think that the names of people Joe Igbokwe listed destroyed Nigeria?
What do you think about Kwankwaso’s new political party?
Let’s have your opinion in this regard, thank you.
