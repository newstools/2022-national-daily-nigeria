Vice President Yemi Osinbajo was in Kano on a condolence visit to the family of the kidnapped and slain five-year-old pupil of a primary school in Kano, Hanifa Abubakar, at Yankaba, Dakata Junction, off Hadejia road, Kano State.
Vice President Osinbajo was accompanied in the condolence visit by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, Senator Kabiru Gaya, and other members of the National Assembly; they were received by the father of the slain pupil, Alhaji Abubakar Abdulsalam, on arrival at the residence of the deceased schoolgirl.
Vice President Osinbajo conveyed the condolences of President Muhammadu Buhari to the family, especially the deceased mother, Murjanatu, and the father, as prayers were offered for the deceased girl and the family.
Father of the murdered schoolgirl, Alhaji Abubakar,  thanked the President and the Vice President for the visit and the condolences to his family over the killing of his daughter.
Abubakar noted that the visit of Vice President Osinbajo was an honour to the entire family, praying for God’s blessings on the President, the VP and for peace in the country.
“I am rather speechless, I don’t have enough words to quantify my joy and gratitude over the visit of the Vice President to my family to condole me.
“As I told him, it should be the other way round, the Vice President is our father; we are supposed to go and pay him a visit, not him coming to us. However, I am grateful, I am sincerely honoured. The only thing I will say is to pray for him and the entire nation, that peace will reign,” Abubakar had said.
