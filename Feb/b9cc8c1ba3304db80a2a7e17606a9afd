A few hours ago popular Nigerian celebrity blogger Tunde Ednut best known as Mufasatundeednut took to his verified Instagram page to react to a throwback video Hushpuppi as he says “Anytime I Watch This Video, I Feel For Him”

According to Hushpuppi, he noted that in his family lineage, he is the only one that was able to escape poverty. Furthermore, he stated that he is wondering why people are trying to bring him down by saying that he doesn’t deserve to be rich when he has already said goodbye to hardship. In conclusion, he affirms that his father hustled so much in life but had nothing to show for it, and more so he could not enjoy anything from the government.
The blogger who seems touched by the young man’s present condition noted that whenever he sees this said video recording, he feels sorry for him. However, he is advising anyone making money through internet fraud to stop and find something legitimate to do so that he or she doesn’t get caught and end up like him.
