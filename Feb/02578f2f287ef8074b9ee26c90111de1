The new-buy from Arsenal, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, hit two goals past Valencia in a 4-1 victory in Mestalla on Sunday that restored Barcelona to the top four in the Spanish La Liga.
Aubameyang scored in each half of the game as Barca fired three goals past Valencia within 15 minutes to the end of the first half.
Valencia returned one goal in the early second half after Carlos Soler headed home a cross from Bryan Gil. Barcelona increased the tally through a shot by Pedri that hit the back of Aubameyang into the net.
The game against Valencia on Sunday was the first time Aubameyang is starting a La Liga match since joining Barcelona from Arsenal in January.
The victory brought Barca back to the top four, being placed ahead of Atletico Madrid on goal difference. Sevilla places second, while Real Madrid is on top of the table with six points.
