The Commissioner for Lands, Survey and Town Planning in Plateau,  Yakubu Dati, says government will ensure the restitution of all lands encroached upon belonging to the  University of Jos.
Dati gave the assurance on Tuesday during an advocacy visit to the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof Ishaya Tanko in Jos.
The commissioner said that the ministry was embarking on property enumeration, recertification of all landed properties and registration of unregistered properties in the state.
He urged the management of the university to take advantage of the subsisting 50 per cent waiver on all lands transactions processing fees in the state as declared by Gov Simon Lalong.
Dati added that there were lots of benefits available from the programme that the institution could  benefit from.
The Vice Chancellor, Prof Ishaya Tanko, who expressed delight on the visit, said the issue of land encroachment had been worrisome to the university community.
He, therefore, called on the ministry to address encroachment and other land related problems threatening the wellbeing of the university.
Tanko assured the ministry of the university management’s readiness to collaborate on other areas of mutual benefit.
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Dati was accompanied on the visit by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mr Ambrose Allaburah, while the DVC Academics, Prof. Rahila Gowon, other senior management of the institution were also on ground to receive the team.
