The attack happened Saturday afternoon.
Our correspondent gathered that one of the occupants of the building was killed.
There has been no official reponse from the police.
Is lead counsel Yomi Aliu has yet to speak either.
The invasion of the property by DSS last July has been a matter of litigation, and court has slammed the federal government with damages for violating Igboho’s rights.
The government has appealed, though, saying Igboho is in Benin Republic, serving a detention time for travel document forgery.
He was declared wanted before his failed attempt to escape to Germany through the Republic of Benin.
