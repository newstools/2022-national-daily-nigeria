Former Governor of Akwa Ibom state and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio has reacted to allegations linking him to activities of some bandits by some politicians in his home state.
In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Jackson Udom, Akpabio described the allegation as an attempt to malign his integrity and character by well-known politicians in Akwa Ibom State.
According to Akpabio, the accusations by those he referred to as well-known politicians from Akwa Ibom State are apparently aimed at tarnishing his image and distracting him from concentrating in his current assignment of bringing development to the Niger Delta region.

There has been brickbats within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state between two different factions over recent controversial endorsement of one of the 2023 guber aspirants in the party and also disagreement about party chairmanship position is the state.
A faction sympathetic to Senator Akpabio had petitioned the APC national leadership and President Muhammadu Buhari to call to order, an APC chieftain in Akwa Ibom State, Chief Don Etiebet, a former Minister, who they accused of working against the peace and progress of the party by masterminding the contentious endorsement.
The Etiebet faction, in response, accused Senator Akpabio of plotting to eliminate the former minister, who resides in Abuja, using bandits.
“The Minister wants the allegation which he describes as weighty to be investigated by relevant security agencies.

“The alleged bandits link to the Minister was contained in an online publication by a group; ABAK 5 MOVEMENT and endorsed by one Engr Edet Okon Ekarika, as its Publicity Secretary.
“He described the allegation as preposterous and a figment of the imagination of purveyors and sponsors of falsehood and blackmail against him and therefore, wishes not to be distracted but be left alone to carry out the mandate given him by President Muhammadu Buhari.”
