Ahead of the 2023 General Elections, A Presidential Hopeful of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is known as an heavyweight politician with a large followership. However, Some Political Stalwarts have berated Tinubu urging him to shelve his Presidential Ambition and support the South-East Region which is yet to produce a Democratically Elected President since 1999.
Recently, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Leader of Afenifere, a Prominent Yoruba Group claimed that the South-West has produced a Two-term President and a Vice-president who is currently serving. Thus, Adebanjo called for a collective Support for the South-East Region to produce Nigeria’s Next President. Below is a list of Two Major Steps South-East APC Presidential Aspirants Can Take To Outsmart Tinubu
1. Pick A Consensus Candidate 
The Trio of David Umahi, Rochas Okorocha and Orji Uzor Kalu are the Top APC Presidential Hopefuls from the South-East. However, the emergence of Three Aspirants may reduce the chances of the region in getting the APC Presidential Ticket. In my opinion, they should step down for each other and agree on a consensus Candidate, a move that will brighten the chances of the South-East in the APC. 

2. Lobby Northern Politicians for Support 
Without doubt, The North has a major Political influence on elections in Nigeria. The South-East APC Presidential Aspirants should also lobby Top Northern Politicians for support for them to have an edge over Tinubu.
