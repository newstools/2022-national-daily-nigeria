There was pandemonium on Saturday after a yet to be identified man was allegedly shot dead and others injured by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency NDLEA at Patey street Lagos Island.



A viral video shows some boys in the area taking cover and hiding in shops.
An Eyewitness said the agents had come to arrests and seize hard drugs when they were attacked by thugs.



The officers were seen firing shots as the angry youths prevented them from carrying out the operation.



Gunshots were fired as the operatives battled to bring order to the area.

This is coming a few days after music stars, Zinoleesky and Mohbad were arrested by the agency for being in possession of hard drugs.



Although they have been released, many Nigerians have been critical of how they were manhandled and arrested without a warrant.
