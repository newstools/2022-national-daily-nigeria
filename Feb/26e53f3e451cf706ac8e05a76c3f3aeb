Peoples Democratic Party chieftain and Publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu has traced his ancestral home to the Ihievbe community in Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State.
Many Nigerians had earlier believed that Dele Momodu is from Ile Ife in Osun State where he was born about 60 years ago.
Dele Momodu, who was a former Presidential candidate had earlier declared his intention to become President under the platform of the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party.
Speaking when he was received on Sunday by his kinsmen, Dele Momodu stated that his reuniting with his ancestral home has finally put an end to all the teasing from those accusing him of not knowing where he came from.
He said he has been a journalist all his life and has never stolen a penny because he has never been a senator or Commissioner.
