Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau and his family abandoned their home after thousands of people descended on Canada’s capital Ottawa to protest against COVID mandates.
The protesters, mostly truckers, carried various placards protesting against vaccine mandates, masks and lockdowns.
Protesters compared vaccine mandates to fascism, one truck carried a Confederate flag and many carried expletive-laden signs targeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The statue of Fox, a national hero who lost a leg to bone cancer as a youngster, was draped with an upside down Canadian flag and a sign that said “mandate freedom.”
Local media reported that Prime Minister Trudeau and his family were escorted out of their home and taken to an undisclosed location in the capital for security purposes.
