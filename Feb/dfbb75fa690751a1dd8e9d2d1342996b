The Chief Judge of Zamfara State, Justice Kulu Aliyu, on Monday appointed a seven-member panel to investigate the allegations of gross misconduct by Zamfara State House of Assembly against Deputy Governor Mahdi Gusau.
Justice Aliyu appointed the investigation committee in response to the request of members of the House for the impeachment of the deputy governor.
The Chief Judge spelt out the mandate of the committee, which include investigating the allegations of gross misconduct, financial fraud, abuse of office, and breach of the constitution against the Deputy Governor Gusau. She did not specify timeline for the committee to complete the investigations and wind up.
Justice Aliyu, inaugurating the committee, acknowledged the receipt of a letter from the Speaker of the House of Assembly, dated February 10, 2022, requesting the constitution of the investigation committee.
The Chief Judge emphasised that the use of the word ‘shall’ in Section 188(5) imposes a duty on her as the Chief Judge of Zamfara State to appoint a panel of seven persons who are of unquestionable character, integrity, and honesty to investigate the allegation against the deputy governor.
She enjoined members of the committee to work as a team and concentrate on the issues contained in the notice of allegation against the deputy governor.
Chairman of the investigative committee, retired Justice Tanko Soba, assured that the committee members will perform their duty in accordance with the constitution, promising a fair hearing for the deputy governor.
The legislators had undermined a subsisting court order restraining the House from impeaching the deputy governor, Gusau.
