The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Police Command found two guns in Ajah at the weekend.










An AK-47 and a pump action were loaded with 8 rounds of live ammunition, RRS said in a statement.
The guns were recovered alongside a black ski mask and one plier, all concealed in a black sack.
A team of officers on a special assignment in the area received intelligence about the suspicious package.
The police believe the weapons were abandoned by armed robbers who could not actualize their criminal intention due to regular patrol.
Commisioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi commended the RRS Commander, his men and the sources that provided the information.
Alabi ordered the Lagos Command’s Special Squad to track and arrest those responsible for the firearms.
