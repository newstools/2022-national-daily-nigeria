Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State is beginning to consolidate his presidential campaign from his home state as he agreed to pay workers in Kogi State minimum wage of N30,000 monthly.
Secretary to the State Government, Folashade Arike Ayoade, at an extensive meeting with labour unions in Lokoja, explained that the COVID-19 pandemic obstructed the regular meeting of the committee on the implementation of the new wage structure after Governor Bello had approved the monthly minimum wage of N30,000 for Kogi workers.
However, the SSG may have forgotten that Governor Bello consistently declared that there was no COVID in Kogi State during the peak of fear of the virus.
Deputy Governor Edward Onoja commended the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress for their “understanding and commitment at reaching the agreement amicably without resorting to strike action.”
Onoja eulogized Governor Bello as a passionate leader for the welfare of civil servants, adding that Bello “would continue to give priority attention to the state’s workforce.”
The State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Comrade Onuh Edoka, noted that Kogi State civil servants have been brought to the same level as their counterparts in other states already implementing the new minimum wage.
Meanwhile, Governor Bello has sustained his campaign for the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling All progressives Congress (APC) for the general elections.
