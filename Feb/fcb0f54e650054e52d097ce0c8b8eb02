In the early hours of today, a lawyer named Kabir Akingbolu was granted an interview by Victor Ayeni, a correspondent of the Punch Newspaper. The interview was wholly based on the lawyer’s experiences with the embattled super cop, Abba Kyari.
The lawyer made many allegations against Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari. Among these allegations was one which reads, “Abba Kyari and his men used a suspect’s eight hundred and forty thousand naira (N840k) to shop from chicken republic and shoprite.”

The lawyer also made it clear that anything he’s said about the arrested law enforcement officer is evidenced. He said he’d filed several cases against Abba Kyari but he doesn’t honor the court by showing up when scheduled.
The lawyer also narrated some other scenarios of criminal acts which Abba Kyari engaged himself. One was about a certain man named Mojeed. This young man was arrested at night by Abba Kyari and his team. After his arrest, his bank account was emptied till he had about two hundred naira left. To Lawyer Kabir Akingbolu, Abba Kyari isn’t a ‘super cop‘ as publicized in the minds of many Nigerians. He is rather a ‘super fraud‘.
