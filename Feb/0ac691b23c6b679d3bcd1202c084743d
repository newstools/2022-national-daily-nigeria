Former President Olusegun Obasanjo at the launch of the autobiography of the Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Tayo Sowunmi, titled ‘Footprints of A Rebel’ in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Saturday, blew hot again, advocating reemergence of resistant movement in Nigeria, a movement involving more rebels, people who will, without fear, tell those in authority something is not right.
Dr. Obasanjo, expressing fury over prevailing leadership failure in the country, declared: “Our country, Nigeria, needs more rebels.
“Those who would look at things straight in the face and say, ‘This is not right! “This, I will not be part of, this is not good for Nigeria.”
The former President was of the view that the rise more rebels, standing and speaking truth, is what will make Nigeria move forward.
Obasanjo further declared: “whoever must live a life of honesty and integrity must be a rebel as Nigerians have no other country to call theirs.
“Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel?
“But it is good. The truth is that if you have to live a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel.
“There would be some time you would be asked have to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that you will become a rebel; you may even become a persona non grata. There is no country that we can call our own except Nigeria.”
Also, the Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, at the event, made a presentation, titled “Worthy Nation Building Legacies By The Older Generation Of Nigerians”, advocating for inter-generational reintegration between the older and younger generations, as part of efforts to rebuild the country.
Bakare decried that efforts to rebuild the nation had suffered setback because the youth are marginalized, while the progressives have abandoned politics.
