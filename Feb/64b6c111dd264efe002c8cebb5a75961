Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has assured the new Enugu Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr Joseph Toby, of his administration’s continued support for the organisation.
Ugwuanyi gave the assurance when the sector commander paid him a courtesy visit on Tuesday at the Government House, Enugu.
The Secretary to the Enugu State Government (SSG), Prof. Simon Ortuanya, who received the commander on behalf of Ugwuanyi said that the FRSC would always get the state government’ support and cooperation.
He intimated Toby about the state government’s various assistance to the corps in the past and assured him that his requests would be looked into.
Earlier, the sector commander told the governor that he was on a courtesy visit to seek the cooperation and collaboration and to build synergy with the state government.
He appealed for the state government’s support in the areas of logistics, work tools, vehicles and the renovation of the corps office complex in Enugu.
Toby said road safety was a shared responsibility as it was necessary to achieve zero crash in the state.
He appealed to the state government to carry the command along in the scheme of things.
The sector commander disclosed that the corps has embarked on the education of drivers in the state.
He urged road users to always exercise patience, leave early enough if they are travelling and get their vehicles properly checked days ahead of their trips to avoid road crash .
