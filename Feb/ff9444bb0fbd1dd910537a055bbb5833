No footballer can play professional football forever, they can only play for some time and when they retire, they have to do something else for a living. While some of them detach themselves from the game, some go on to become pundits, sporting directors, and football managers.
Austin Jay-Jay Okocha was one of the most gifted players of his generation, he is tactically gifted, but he doesn’t see himself becoming a coach now due to some reasons as he knows his strength. Many people would like to see him on the bench, but he just ended such speculations.
As per Pulse Sports who asked him if he was interested in coaching, he said “For now, I’ll say no because it is a tough job, and it is not for everybody. I see myself more of an administrator and if I ever plan to go into the football business, I think that is what I will do.”
He said he would love to be in the office, try to put a good structure in place to enable those coaches to function properly, and doesn’t think he will make a good coach. I think he will be a good football admirator with his knowledge and experience in the game.
