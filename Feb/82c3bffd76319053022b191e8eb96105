Ahead of the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for the 26th of February, 2022, There are Top Contestants to watch out for the National Chairmanship Position. It’s no longer a news that about Twelve Aspirants from the Northern Region are jostling to replace the Incumbent National Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mai Mala Buni. However, Below is a list of Three Top Contenders That May Succeed Buni
1. Senator Tanko Al-makura 
Al-makura belongs to the CPC Bloc which is yet to occupy the APC National Chairmanship Position since the establishment of the party in 2013. The Ex-Governor turned Senator who hails from Nasarawa State has the backing of majority of the Former and Serving Governors in the party. Due to his closeness to President Muhammadu Buhari, He might have an easy ride to emerge as the Next APC National Chairman.

2. Senator Sani Musa 
Musa who currently represents Niger East Senatorial District at the National Assembly has the support of his State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello and majority of the APC Members in the National Assembly. Equally, Musa who is popularly known as Senator 313 also enjoys the backing of Top APC Chieftains especially in the Northern Region.
3. Senator George Akume
Akume belongs to the ACN Bloc of the Ruling Party. He is currently the only National Chairmanship Aspirant with a vast Political Experience. The Benue State-born Serving Minister has been occupying political positions since 1999. Also, his Cordial Relationship with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the APC National Leader might be an added advantage to his Aspiration.
