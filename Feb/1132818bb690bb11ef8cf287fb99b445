Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney, has given a damning assessment of the club.
Rooney, who is Manchester United’s all-time leading goalscorer, is now a manager at Derby County.
Rooney said that Manchester United cannot win the Premier League title in two or three years.
Man United are currently languishing in fifth place amid another disappointing campaign.
Rooney, 36, told talkSPORT, “I said it back in 2009 and 2010, losing Ronaldo and Tevez was a big loss. I still believe they’ve struggled to recover from that.
“Losing Alex Ferguson and David Gill was a big blow for them. Ed Woodward came in and I think Ed has done a good job.
“They’ve changed the manager a few times and they just need that stability and have some time to work with the players.
“Man United aren’t going to win the league in the next two or three years. They need to use this time so in the next three or four years they are challenging again.
“They are a long way off it at the minute.”
