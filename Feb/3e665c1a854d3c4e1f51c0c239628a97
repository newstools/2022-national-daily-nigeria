Chelsea and Tottenham legends, Jason Cundy and Jamie O’Hara have noted that Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte is regretting joining the club.
Both former Premier League stars shared the view after Conte hit out at Tottenham’s transfer business and winning mentality in a stunning interview with Sky Italia on Wednesday.
Spurs are struggling with form and Conte hit at the club, saying they are now ‘weaker’ after the January window.
Tottenham brought in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus, but before then, four senior players were allowed to leave the club in the persons of Tanguy Ndomble, Dele Alli, Bryan Gil and Giovani Lo Celso.
“We lost four players in January. Four important players for Tottenham, and we brought in only two. So, even just in terms of numbers, rather than reinforce the squad, we on paper weakened it,” Conte cried out.
And reacting to this, Cundy told talkSPORT that the former Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan boss, “Basically he’s saying, why have I come to Spurs?
“That is a statement of regret. He knows it’s going to come back.
“It’s damning what he has said there. But he’s talking facts.”
And O’Hara echoed Cundy’s sentiments, saying Conte’s comments will have done his players no good.
O’Hara said: “It’s too honest. I’m not happy about it. He’s covering his own back and digging everyone else out at the club.
“I know he’s speaking facts, but he can’t do that as manager.
“If you’re a player you’re a little bit disappointed in the gaffer there.
“You can see he’s not happy, on the sidelines, he looks like he’s crushed and the weight of the world is on his shoulders and he doesn’t know how to get out.
“He’s always had great players and he’s always had clubs who want to win the league and now he’s at a club that doesn’t want to win the league.”
