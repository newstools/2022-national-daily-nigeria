The federal government says it has directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited and oil marketers to ensure a robust supply of petroleum products in order to curb the current fuel scarcity in the country.
In a statement by the CEO of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency, Mr. Farouk Ahmed, the current scarcity was caused by bad products which are being withdrawn from the market.
According to Ahmed, the methanol quantity which was above Nigeria’s specification was discovered in a supply chain, which has since been isolated.
