During the proceedings at the federal high court in Abuja, Kanu’s lead counsel Mike Ozekhome told Justice Nyako DSS has yet to allow the IPOB leader to change his clothes as she ordered.
The judge then asked the DSS to explain why.
And the DSS Director of Legal Service said clothes that were brought for the defendant had lion’s head embroidered on them, and the defendant (Mr Kanu) can’t wear clothes with a lion’s head.
“Clothes with lion’s head offend the standard operating procedures of the SSS,” he said.
Justice Nyako then asked Kanu what type of clothes he preferred.
“I want to wear the clothes of my people, Isi Agu,” he said.
