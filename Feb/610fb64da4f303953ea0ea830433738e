Wife of the Ondo State Governor,
Mrs. Betty Anyanwu Akeredolu, is currently nursing a political ambition after her husband serves his term in office.

The highly influential first lady who hails from Imo State is currently gathering her political structure back in her home state where she is planning to launch her own political empire with all political machinery already in place.

Betty is currently nursing an ambition to represent Imo West at the hallowed Red Chamber.

“First lady is currently gathering all available financial resources to carve a political structure in Imo State to enable her contest and win the Imo East senatorial seat in coming years after her husband would have handed over as Governor.

Betty Akeredfolu is a known breast cancer survivor who has been at the forefront for the promotion of early cancer detection to enable victims to get early care so as to avert death.

She has been involved in several campaigns using her office as the first lady of Ondo state to ensure public awareness in fighting cancer to a standstill.

She is constantly reaching out to many voters within her political constituency and also silently speaking to top stakeholders of her next political move with the support of her husband.

In Ondo State, she opened room for her kingsmen in her husband’s Government that’s why they have talked her into giving politics a shot in her hometown after her husband’s tenure as Governor must have elapsed.”

A source also disclosed that while many are kicking against the development, the Ondo First Lady is not relenting in making her political ambition see the light of the day with heavy investment in party activities in Imo State supporting Governor Hope Uzodinma’s second term bid.
