The governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike, has reportedly declared that one of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftains and a staunch supporter of Atiku’s 2023 presidential bid, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, appears to be working for the All Progressives Congress, APC.
The governor’s accusation which was contained in a recent Punch report, pointed at Dokpesi’s demeanor within the party as it regards the 2023 presidency, as the reason for the suspicion. According to Wike, Dokpesi’s behavior; especially in allegedly peddling the rumour that some PDP governors went on a week-long trip to Europe to determine the presidential and vice presidential candidates of the party; constitute a deliberate act to divide the PDP and by extension, ruin the party’s chances at the 2023 poll. Going by his submission, it is clear that the governor is convinced that the chieftain’s attitude is sowing the seeds of division within the opposition party, which would certainly favour the ruling APC if it continues.
Although governor Wike declared that he wasn’t against Chief Dokpesi’s decision to support and project former vice president, Atiku Abubakar for presidency, he, however, admonished the PDP chieftain to stop behaviors capable of polarizing the party in trying to do so. The question is; will the chieftain heed the advice of the governor, especially considering the current tensed politics around who gets the party’s ticket in 2023?
