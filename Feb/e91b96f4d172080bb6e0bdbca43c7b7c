Ndukwe, a former Chairman of MTN and former executive vice-chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, takes over from Nigeria’s former Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Dr. Christopher Kolade who retired after 15 years of leading the company.
According to a press statement, the development rides on the back of its 30th anniversary which saw the company expand its operations through the establishment of two subsidiaries – SystemSpecs Technology Services Limited (STSL) and Remita Payment Services Limited (RPSL).
John Obaro, Group Managing Director, SystemSpecs said the development is in line with the organisation’s vision of deepening its capacity to meet the technology needs of a broader market.

We have raised a new generation of Nigerian software talents and empowered private and public sector organisations of all sizes to effectively manage their people, finances, payments and collections.”
Henceforth, the firm will now operate as three distinct entities: a holding company, SystemSpecs Holdings Limited and two subsidiaries – Remita Payment Services Limited (RPSL) which focuses on payment and affiliated services and SystemSpecs Technology Services Limited (STSL) which focuses on a wide array of technology solutions and services.
