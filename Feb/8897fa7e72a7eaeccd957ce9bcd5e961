As the 2023 presidential election approaches, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the national leader of the All Progressive Congress and a former governor of Lagos state, is widely regarded as one of the politicians that might make it to Aso Rock.
Currently, the race to get the APC presidential ticket is very tight, as many giant politicians, mostly in the South East, have declared their intention of running for it, while it is believed that many more will soon declare their intention too.
If Tinubu could luckily get the APC presidential ticket that he is eyeing, there would be a lot of advantages for him because Tinubu is already gaining ground in the north, which may make him unstoppable by the opposition party in 2023.
How is Tinubu gaining ground in the north?
Ever since he declared his intention to run, Tinubu has been enjoying the support of many leaders and elders of the northern part of the country. Some days ago, Governor Kano Abdullahi Ganduje made it known that Tinubu is not alone, as the whole North is behind him.
Apart from that, President Muhammadu Buhari’s adviser, Bashir Ahmed, has stated that he supported Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s intention of becoming President Buhari’s successor as the man has a lot to offer Nigeria.
Not only that, the former governor of Bornu state, Kashim Shettima, makes it known that he stands strong behind Tinubu as the man who deserves to rule this country, because he needs to be rewarded for the good he has done for the north.
Even the Governor of Niger State, Sani Bello, a respected northern elder, Tanko Yakasai and so on, have declared their support for Tinubu, which shows that Tinubu is gaining a lot of ground in the north, which would help him a lot in the 2023 election.
