And kids’ stories just took a positive turn.
According the governor’s media aide Jubril Gawat, the two girls couldn’t go to shool because their parents could not pay for the term school fees.
Chinedu is nine, and her mum a teacher who farmed her out to the other woman. Hussein, 12, is the daughter of Chinedu’s mistress, and both were going to grind buckets of beans when the governor spotted around Anthony Village.
“My encounter with them gave me the opportunity to hear their stories and I have taken it upon myself to ensure that these girls never suffer such fate again,’ the governor said.
He vowed he would not leave the kids alone.
“There are several Amarachis and several Suwebats out there, who will not have this kind of opportunity. Every one of us can take the same decision and listen to stories of kids who may be vulnerable.”
