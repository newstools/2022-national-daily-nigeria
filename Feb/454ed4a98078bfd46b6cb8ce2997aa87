A military dictatorship is a dictatorship in which the military exerts complete or substantial control over political authority, and the dictator is often a high ranked military officer.
1. Benito Mussolini
One of the earliest acts by Benito Mussolini’s fascist government in Italy was its invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party.
2. Adolf Hitler
On September 1, 1939, the German army under Adolf Hitler launched an invasion of Poland that triggered the start of World War II. The battle for Poland only lasted about a month before a Nazi victory.
3. Saddam Hussein
On August 1990, Iraq’s army under President Saddam Hussein launched an attack on Kuwait. Within hours, the capital city of the small oil-rich country fell, while Kuwait’s head of state, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, fled to Saudi Arabia. Responding to Kuwait’s call for help, the U.S. attacked Iraq in turn and the latter failed to defend itself against the former’s military might.
