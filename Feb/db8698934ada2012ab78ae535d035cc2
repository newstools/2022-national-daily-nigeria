A man reportedly died after sexual intercourse with a lady at a hotel in Rivers state.
The unidentified man is said to have slumped at the hotel located in Ada George in the Obio-Akpor local government area of the oil-rich state.
According to report, the tragedy happened hours after the man and woman checked into the hotel on Wednesday morning.
Reports say the man booked a room with the lady but ended up collapsing and becoming unconscious while in the act.
The lady is said to have rushed out of their room and banged at the door of another guest to raise the alarm that her male partner had slumped.
The manager of the hotel and security men raced to the scene and immediately took the man to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
A source who pleaded anonymity confided in the newspaper that the lady said the deceased took a drink suspected to be a sex enhancer at a joint the previous night ahead of the meeting.
National Daily gathered that the lady and the manager of the hotel have been arrested and an investigation is ongoing.
