Bandits have continued to sustain their onslaught in rural communities in Zamfara State, killing over 27 persons in separate assault on Nasarawar Mai Fara in Tsafe Local Government Area and Yar Katsina in Bungudu Local Government Area in Zamfara State.
In the attack on Nasarawar Mai Fara community last Thursday, the bandits were said  to have killed 17 persons, and killing at least 10 persons in the attack on Yar Katsina community.
It was gathered that the Police Public Relations Officer of the Zamfara State Police Command, SP Muhammed Shehu, had acknowledged on Saturday that “one village was attacked in Tsafe and one in Yar Katsina, attacked on Friday, and the area is being manned by the military,”
The PPRO added that “Brigade Commander and the Commissioner for Security, Mamman Tsafe, visited the village on Friday and accessed the existing security arrangement in the community and to build the confidence of the locals.”
The bandits were said to have attacked Nasarawar Mai Fara in Tsafe Local Government Area because the residents did not pay a N40 million levy the bandits imposed on the community.
A notorious bandits leader, Ado Aleru, was identified to have imposed the levy on the community.
There have been similar insinuations in some other parts of the northwest that bandits currently collect levies from locals to prevent attack, essentially, levies from farmers for permission to go to their farms.
