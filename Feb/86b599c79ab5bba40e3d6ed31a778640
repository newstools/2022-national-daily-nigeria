To some, Governor David Umahi’s decision to run for presidency in 2023 under the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, is ill – timed, due to the fact that he just defected to the party not too long ago. However, considering the different factors currently at play in the nation’s political discourse as it regards the presidency, Umahi may be occupying a strategic position against the likes of Tinubu, Osjnbajo in the race for the APC presidency ticket.
As it stands, Governor David Umahi remains the only notable candidate from the Southeast region currently vying for the presidency under the ruling party. Although it is still unclear whether the party will support the region’s bid to actualize the Igbo presidency, there exists the possibility that Umahi’s bid may receive boost due to the agitation for the Southeast to produce the next president. As noted in a viewpoint article published by the Vanguard recently, Umahi stands to benefit a lot from the clamour for the presidency to return to the south and by extension, to the Southeast. Nevertheless, will the Southeast factor be enough for the Ebonyi state Governor to get the needed support to defeat well established APC politicians like Bola Tinubu and the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo (should he decide to run) in the race for the party’s ticket?
Although, Umahi’s pedigree within APC may not match that of the Southwest duo, the sympathy currently growing around the idea of Igbo presidency may give him the needed advantage in the race for the party’s presidency ticket in 2023 especially, if he continues to be the only candidate from the southeast.
Nevertheless, will APC be willing to give a newcomer like David Umahi its presidency ticket?
