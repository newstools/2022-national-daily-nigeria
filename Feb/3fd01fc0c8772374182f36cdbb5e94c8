Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Tuesday asserted that he has the requisite experience to be President of Nigeria, saying that it is not possible for anybody to say he is more qualified to be President than him.
According to Governor Wike: “For somebody of my kind and record, a governor and a minister, I don’t even see anybody who will tell me that he is much more qualified than me, I don’t think that is possible.
“Assuming today, I want to run for the office of the President, what quality do you think I do not have? Why do you think I cannot provide the right leadership for Nigeria to move forward?
“It is not good for anybody to say ‘my aspirant is the best of the aspirants. I don’t think so.
“All I preach is that people should talk on issues. Nigeria has a problem. If they have given you the opportunity, what are you going to do to make sure that Nigerians benefit?”
Governor Wike also refuted insinuations that he is positioning himself to be vice presidential candidate to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections.
The Rivers State Governor has been an ally of Governor Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State.
