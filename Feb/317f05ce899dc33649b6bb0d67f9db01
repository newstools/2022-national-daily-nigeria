Disgraced Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) and head of the IRT, Abba Kyari faces demotion from his present rank to an Assistant Commissioner of Police.

This was part of the recommendations of the disciplinary committee set up by the Nigeria Police Force after it reviewed the report of the Special Investigation Panel that investigated Kyari over an indictment by an affidavit of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Committee found Kyari to have fraternised with fraudsters and also violated the social media policies of the Nigeria Police Force by responding to the FBI’s indictment on his Facebook page without recourse to laid down procedures.

The Police have begun further investigations against the suspended DCP following observations by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN.

Malami had observed that there exists a prima facie against Kyari but the Police report was too watery to nail him in Court.

He had said, “That there exists a prima facie case of conspiracy, collaboration, receipt, conversion, transfer and/or retention of proceeds of unlawful activities contrary to the provision of Section 15, 17 & 18 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004 and Section 17 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Est) Act, Cap EI Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 against DCP Abba Kyari and other suspects in view of the overwhelming evidence showing the nature of his disguised financial transactions and activities Ramon Abbas (Hushpuppi) and others.”

Meanwhile, the Police Service Commission has given the Police a two-week ultimatum to conclude further investigation into the allegation against Kyari.
