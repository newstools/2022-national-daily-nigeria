The German, who scored the winning goal in last year’s Champions League final against Man City, converted a 117th-minute spot-kick to give the Blues a 2-1 victory and land the final trophy missing from the club’s collection.
Romelu Lukaku has scored the only goal of the Blues’ semi-final win over Al Hilal and opened the scoring with a powerful header but Raphael Veiga’s penalty levelled for the Brazilian side and forced extra-time.
Thomas Tuchel, back in the dugout after missing the semi-final through Covid, made a big call in restoring Edouard Mendy in goal after his return from the AFCON as one of four changes to his starting lineup.
The Blues boss was forced into a rejig midway through a fairly drab first-half as Mason Mount hobbled off to be replaced by Christian Pulisic.
Lukaku eventually made the breakthrough ten minutes after the restart with a thumping header from Callum Hudson-Odoi’s cross, but a handball by Thiago Silva spotted by VAR allowed Veiga to restore parity from 12 yards.
The game appeared to be drifting towards penalties but Cesar Azpilicueta’s volley was blocked by the hand of Luan Garcia three minutes before the end ion extra-time with VAR again intervening to award the penalty.
Azpilicueta at one point looked set to take the penalty but eventually ceded to Havertz, who calmly sent the ‘keeper the wrong way. Palmeiras’ misery was compounded deep into stoppage time when Luan was sent off after denying Havertz a clear run on goal.
