President Vladimir Putin of Russian on Sunday flayed the government of Ukrainian for delaying peace talk on the war in their country. The Russian President accused Ukraine’s President Zelensky of wasting “an opportunity” to hold talks over the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia disclosed that Putin had explained to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel “the course of a special military operation to protect Donbas”.
Russia in a statement indicated that during the call, Putin “also noted that the Russian delegation is in the Belarus city of Gomel and is ready for negotiations with representatives of Kyiv, who, showing inconsistency, have not yet taken advantage of this opportunity”.
The statement added that Bennet proposed the participation of Israel in the talks as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine “in order to halt the hostilities”.
Bennett’s office acknowledged the two men “discussed the situation between Russia and Ukraine”.
The call was made after reports revealing that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had requested the intervention of Israel to mediate in the conflict after the Russian invasion.
Israel’s Prime Minister Bennett and President Zelensky were said to have interacted last on Friday.
President Zelensky accepted talks with Russia but on Sunday Minsk as venue of the dialogue, arguing that Belarus provided Russia operational base to attack Ukraine.
