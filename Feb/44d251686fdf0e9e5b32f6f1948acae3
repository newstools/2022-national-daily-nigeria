The Blues have enjoyed a successful moment under the German Manager Thomas Tuchel, as they have proven to be the best club in Europe and also in the world having won three mighty trophies which are the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.
Despite their mega achievements within this period, they have lost the formidable form they had early this season following an inconsistent performance which has seen them drop so badly from the top of the EPL table to the third position.
Having won the FCWC, another final awaits them on 27th February, as they would face the in-form Liverpool in the Carabo Cup final. The game would really be a tough one, as the blues would be anticipating to double their trophy this season. But there are some concerns that might deprive them of making it a reality which are;
Their inability to maintain their clean sheet record – One outstanding record Chelsea had last season was the ability to maintain clean sheet record. This helped them to go far and scale through some games as they conceded little or no goal. But on the contrary, the blues have been unable to maintain it lately, as they have conceded more goals recently. Playing against a scoring team like the Reds could deny them the chance of lifting their second trophy of the season.
Their Inability to create more scoring chances and maximizing them – It might interest you to know that Chelsea have barely scored more than two goals in two months, and this has terribly affected their progress. One bitting issue in Chelsea is the poor performance of their strikers. It’s so sad that their defenders have scored more goals and made more assists than the strikers. This could limit their chances of winning the Reds in Carabo Cup final.
