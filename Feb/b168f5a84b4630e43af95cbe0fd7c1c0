In a statement signed by the former spokesman of the Nigerian Army, Brig.-Gen. Sani Usman (Rtd), Buratai said such calls and posters should be discountenanced as they did not emanate from him.
“The attention of His Excellency, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai (rtd), Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Republic of Benin and former Chief of Army Staff, has been drawn to calls and dissemination of campaign posters calling on him to join partisan politics and contest for Presidential candidature of one of the political parties by some persons.
“However, it is essential to state that the Ambassador has never indicated interest, discussed with, or directed anyone on such matters,” the statement read.
“Therefore, such calls and posters should be discountenanced as they did not emanate from him, nor is he interested in them.
“It is entirely the handiwork of some people for reasons best known to them.
Buratai said he remais loyal and grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the opportunity to serve.
“He, however, wishes to thank all well-meaning persons, friends and well-wishers who showed concern over this development.”
