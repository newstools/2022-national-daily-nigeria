The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Ayuba Wabba, has alleged that the emergence of queues in filling stations was part of conspiracy theories to force subsidy down the throat of Nigerians.
The NLC president levelled the allegation on Tuesday in Abuja at the Nigeria Union of Teachers solemn assembly.
Wabba said the NLC was watching closely as events unfold.
He said: “We are very watchful.
“We have seen that queues are surfacing which means that there is a conspiracy theory to force the policy of removal of fuel subsidy down the throat of Nigerians.
“We have found out that some of these filling stations have products with three to five dispensing machines but they will use one and then close by 5pm.
“This was not the case before the pronouncement of the policy.
“Filling stations that do operate 24 hours have stopped operating and no one is giving explanation.
“The Nigerian workers and Nigerians in general are continuously being exploited and we have the responsibility to protect all of us from all the cabals that are repeatedly benefiting from this so called subsidies.”
