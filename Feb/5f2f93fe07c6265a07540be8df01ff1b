Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that affects the prostate gland. Males have a small walnut-shaped gland called the prostate that generates seminal fluid, which nourishes and transports sperm. One of the most common types of cancer is prostate cancer.
Many prostate cancers are slow-growing and limited to the prostate gland, where they are unlikely to cause substantial harm. In this article, I’ll be talking about some if the causes of prostrate cancer and how to overcome it.
But let’s look at some symptoms of prostrate cancer below;
1. Difficulty urinating.
2. Blood in the urine.
3. Blood in the sperm.
4. Bone ache.
5. Extreme weight loss without putting in any efforts.
6. Erectile dysfunction.

So let’s look at the causes of prostrate cancer.
1. History of the family
If a blood related has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, such as a parent, brother, or kid, your risk may be enhanced. Additionally, if you have a strong family history of prostate cancer or a gene that increases the risk of the cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher.
2. Old age
As you become older, your chances of developing prostate cancer grow. After the age of 50, it becomes more common.
3. Obesity
Obese people may have a higher risk of prostate cancer than people who are considered to be of normal weight, though studies have yielded mixed results. Obese people are more likely to have cancer that is more aggressive and that returns after therapy.
4. Race
Black people have a higher risk of prostate cancer than those of other races for unknown reasons. Prostate cancer is also more likely to be aggressive or advanced in Black men.
