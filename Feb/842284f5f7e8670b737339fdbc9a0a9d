Both the former governor of Lagos state, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the former vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, are believed to have the highest chance of getting the presidential ticket from the two biggest parties in the country, the APC and the PDP.
Bola Tinubu has declared his intention to run and he is consulting many people across the state, but Atiku has not declared his intention to run for president, but he is also currently consulting with people to raise awareness.
Firstly, the sagacity of Tinubu in the north and how many people are endorsing him in the region, coupled with the fact that his party, the APC, has the highest governors and chairpersons in the region, will help him a lot. There is a high chance these people will work to gather votes for Tinubu in the north for their party to remain in power, as they won’t do anything anti-party, unlike Atiku.
Apart from that, let’s recall that Tinubu was part of the squad that knocked Atiku out of getting the APC presidential ticket in the 2011 primary election, which shows that Tinubu knew Atiku very well and he might be planning another way to knock him out again in the 2023 presidential election if both run.
Another reason is that the South East region, where Atiku may receive a large number of votes, has vowed not to support him if he hijacks the PDP presidential ticket from South East politicians. Furthermore, they may end up voting for Bola Tinubu, who is from the same southern region as them.
