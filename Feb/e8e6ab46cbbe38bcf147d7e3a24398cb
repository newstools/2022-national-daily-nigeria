The Court of Appeal in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Thursday restored the leadership of the Governor Abdulahi Ganduje’s faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State. The court nullified the judgment of a High Court sitting in the FCT which voided the ward and local government congresses of the APC faction led by Governor Ganduje in Kano State for lack of jurisdiction. The FCT Court of Appeal declared that the FCT High Court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The Appeal Court insisted that the suit was not a pre-election matter but an internal matter of the APC, and therefore, the APC leaders were in better position to resolve the matter.
The APC faction led by former Governor Ibrahim Shekarau had filed a suit challenging the ward and local government congresses conducted by the APC faction led by Governor Ganduje.  The High Court in FCT had nullified the Ganduje faction’s congresses, upholding Shekarau’s APC as the authentic party structure in Kano State.
