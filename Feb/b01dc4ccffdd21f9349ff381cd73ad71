The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State on Monday declared Governor Godwin Obaseki a total failure in the leadership of the state. APC State Chairman in Edo, Col. David Imuse (rtd), stated that the Obaseki administration is “a total failure” disclosing that the party is perfecting strategies to win back Edo State in 2023.
According to Imuse: “We hope that with this strategy that we are going to adopt, we will take the party to the next level. Do not forget Edo is an APC state. What we currently have is an aberration.”
Imuse emphasized that his emergence as the SPC State chairman in Edo is a call to service, assuring that he will lead the party to victory and reclaim the state for APC.
The APC State chairman stated Governor Obaseki of the PDP has not performed much to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of Edo State. He added that the Obaseki administration has taken the state back to the 17th century.
Imuse declared: “The government is a total failure, walk on the street of Benin, ask an ordinary man, he will tell you the administration has taken Edo back to the 17th century.
“As far as Edo is concern today, the government is a monumental failure.
“It is a government that has incapacitated the judiciary; it is a government that has not allowed the legislature to function.
“There is nothing working in Edo, you know it. I do not need to re-emphasise it.”
Meanwhile, members of the Edo State Working Committee (SWC) are yet to be inaugurated, except the state chairman.  He, however, assured that the other SWC members will be inaugurated soon.
