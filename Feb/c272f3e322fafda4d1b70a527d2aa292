Seven traffic robbers have been arrested by the Lagos Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) near the Ikeja City Mall (ICM). It was revealed that some members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Mile 2 park, were the ones who raised alarm concerning these criminals and also assisted the police in getting them arrested. The suspects, Anifowoshe Kolawole, Patrick Ameke, John Britto, Segun Peters, Kabiru Odeh, Nurudeen Suraj and Dennis Ikuvbogie while been interviewed by the newsmen on Friday confessed to the crimes.
The suspects in their own words said, “Until the day we were arrested, we’ve usually succeeded in our operations because we always pretend to be beggars before robbing people around the mall. Sometimes, we used to change our strategies and pretend as if we are nose mask vendors so that people won’t easily detect that we are armed robbers”.
However, the Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi commended civilians that provide intelligence to the security agency and also vowed that the suspects would be charged to book for their criminal act.
