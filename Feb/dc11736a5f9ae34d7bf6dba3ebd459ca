In about 60 hours of military hostilities in Ukraine by the Russian forces, Ukraine has run into shortage of fuel and ammunition. An official of the Ukrainian defence ministry on Friday morning revealed that Ukraine is suffering shortage of fuel. He explained that the major source of fuel to Ukraine is Belarus, lamenting that Russia has occupied Belarus, cutting off fuel supply to Ukraine.
The official said that Ukraine needs support in arms supply, saying they need more arms and that people are being equipped for self defence.
The official also said that the city of Sumy is currently under contention, saying that fighting was going on as at Saturday morning and that Ukraine forces are fighting back strongly to protect the country.
The defence official said that Ukraine’s air forces is still doing very well and can stand air strikes but that the ground forces are raising concerns and needs support.
As at Friday, Russian forces were about 20 kilometres away from Kyiv, the country’s capital, after 48 hours of military operations.
Citizens and residents in Ukraine have besieged the metro station for safety. The Mayor of Kyiv told people to run to the metro stations as the war escalates, saying that the metro stations are safe. Many others, including students, have been taking refuge in tunnels, while several others are fleeing the Ukraine to nearby countries like Poland, Estonia, and others.
