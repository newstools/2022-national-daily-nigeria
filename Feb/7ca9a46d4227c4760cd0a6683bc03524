He took to his social media platforms this afternoon, expressing his views on the current spat between Ukraine and Russia.
Reno Omokri said in a tweet that Vladimir Putin is Russia’s equivalent of General Sani Abacha in the 1960s. That’s what Abacha wanted to do when he was Nigeria’s military head of state, Reno Omokri said, comparing it to what Putin is doing in Ukraine. Reno believes that Sani Abacha’s alleged ability to make people disappear is similar to Vladimir Putin’s ability to do the same for his enemies. At the end of his speech, Reno Omokri thanked God for rescuing Nigeria from its own Putin.
Former Nigerian military leader Sani Abacha, who ruled the country from 1993 to 1998 and was widely regarded as a strict leader, has died. Vladimir Putin is also a tough guy who always has Russia’s best interests at heart, even if his methods aren’t popular with everyone.
