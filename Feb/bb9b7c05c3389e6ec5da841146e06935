The Police Public Relations Officer in Delta, DSP Bright Edafe, says the command has 11 persons for their alleged involvement in a cult clash at Agbarho Community in Ughelli North Local Government Area.
Edafe made the disclosure in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Warri on Tuesday.
He stated that the suspects were arrested on Sunday by a combined team of operatives, comprising the Anti-Cult Unit, Dragon Patrol Team and operatives from the Agbarho Police Division.
According to him, two rival cult groups – Eiye and Black Axe Confraternity – had a deadly clash in Agharho, leading to the death of five persons.
He stated that the Commissioner of Police, Mr Ari Ali, immediately deployed the operatives to restore sanity in the community.
He stated that the Divisional Police Officer, Sam Ogwa, led the team for the operation.
Edafe added that the team recovered two pump action guns, one cut-to-size locally made gun, eight expended cartridges and 10 rounds of live cartridges during the operation.
“The situation has been brought under control and more patrol teams have been deployed to forestall any further breakdown of law and order in the community,’’ he added.
He stated that manhunt for the other fleeing suspects was ongoing and solicited for useful information from the locals that could facilitate their arrest.
