The Edo Chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), has condemned the abduction of its chairman, Alhaji Abdul-Hammid Egele by gunmen.
Egele was said to have been abducted by gunmen at his resident in Jattu, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo on Monday evening while his driver was killed in the process.
The association in a statement signed by its Asst. Secretary, Mrs Angelina Aigbokhai which was made available to newsmen on Wednesday expressed worry over the manner its chairman was abducted.
They called for the unconditional release of the chairman, saying that the abduction was orchestrated by enemies of the state.
“The abduction which is seen as planned and orchestrated by enemies of Nigeria is one among many that have taken place in the country and Edo state in particular.
“IPMAN as a body will not take this as a joke but as an attack on the entire body which will be highly resisted.
“The association, therefore, call on the Inspector- General of Police, the Department of State Security Service (DSS), the Nigeria Army and other relevant authorities to ensure the release of our chairman unhurt.’’
The association also sympathised with the family of the driver that was killed in the attack and those of the gallant officers of the Nigeria Police who were shot and injured during their gun duel with the gunmen.
“It is our prayer that Baba is released unconditionally and unhurt,’’ the statement said.
