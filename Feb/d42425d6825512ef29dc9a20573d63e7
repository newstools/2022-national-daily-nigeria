Currently, Chelsea is the holder of the UEFA Champions League trophy which they won last season after beating Manchester City in the finals. The Blues have a good squad depth and if Thomas Tuchel utilizes it well he might retain this precious trophy at the end of the season.
However, it’s going to be difficult for Chelsea to retain the trophy because this season’s tournament is more competitive when compared to last season. In this piece, am going to share with you two clubs that have the highest chances of winning the trophy based on the current performance in the tournament.
1. Liverpool
The Reds are currently second in the Premier League standings. Klopp is among the favorite managers who have the highest chances of lifting the champions league. The former champions finished top of Group B with 18 points after winning all six matches. They will face Inter Milan in the Round of 16 and have a higher chance of advancing to the quarter-finals.
Liverpool has one of the best attacking front three in Europe this season. Sadio Mane, Mo Salah, and Diego Jota have already contributed to over 35 goals this season.
2. Bayern Munich
Munich is the second club that is determined to snatch the trophy from Chelsea. The Bavarians finished top of Group E with 18 points and have an easy fixture against RB Salzburg in the round of 16. On top of all that, they possess one of the most talented attacking players in Europe.
Robert Lewandowski has established himself as a prolific goal-scorer for the club in recent seasons. Bayern Munich front led by Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Muller, and Serge Gnabry has already scored more than 40 goals this season.
