Vice President Yemi Osinbajo during the funeral at the Cathedral Church Of Christ, Marina, eulogized late Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of interim national government in 1993, as a man of high value that will be greatly missed for his contributions to national development.
According to Osinbajo: “Ernest Shonekan lived an extraordinary life. But perhaps what deserves greater attention is the way he carried himself through life and the high values he exemplified.

“That genuine respect that he had for all people of all classes, religions, and tribes, his unflinching belief in the inherent goodness in everyone, his love and generosity not just for his family but to all.
“His knowledge and experience-driven leadership and counsel that he provided always with unfailing humility and courteousness; these were the unique virtues that underpinned his extraordinary achievements.”

Shonekan was laid to rest on Friday in Lagos. he died at the age of 86 years.
In attendance at the funeral were the Secretary to the Government of Federation, Boss Mustapha; Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed; former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon; Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, including former Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State and many others.
