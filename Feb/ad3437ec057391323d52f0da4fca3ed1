Ahead of the upcoming gubernatorial primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Bankole Omisore, a former Special Assistant (New Media) to ex-Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, on Saturday advocated that Senator Ademola Adeleke is the best choice to clinch the party’s ticket and help defeat the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.










Omisore, took to his official Twitter, @MrbanksOmisore to warn PDP stakeholders on the dangers of disrupting the party’s process amidst reports of alleged interference in the affairs of the Osun State Chapter of PDP.
His words, “No gubernatorial aspirant except for Sen Ademola Adeleke in Osun PDP has the popularity, war chest, name recognition, and ability to put together a solid team to wrestle power from APC/Oyetola come July. So why are folks that can’t win one LG election doing a pissing contest?
