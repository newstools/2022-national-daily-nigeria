Amazon is still immured in COVID-19 fallacies and the intricacies of covid vaccines that complicate human health.  Amazon authorities in a staff memo last Thursday threatened that its workers who test positive to COVID-19 but not fully vaccinated “will not be eligible for paid leave after March 18.)
Amazon, however, in the Thursday memo, notified workers that “they will no longer have to wear masks inside warehouses from Friday if they have been fully vaccinated,” noting that local regulations allow.
Meanwhile, several European countries are already in the process of scraping vaccine mandates and reviewing the status of COVID-19 which most countries now consider not to be different from Flu, and therefore, less harmful than it is being propagated by those pushing the agenda.
Meanwhile, The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on Wednesday delivered a split judgment 2 to 1 upholding to block the vaccine mandate of President Joe Biden, ordered by a Texas-based federal judge in his judgement on January 21.
The federal appeals court, therefore, inclined to restraining the Biden administration from forcing COVID-19 vaccines on for federal workers in the U.S.
Apparently, Amazon may be in dilemma over its vaccine mandate enforcement on workers.
