The difference between murder and manslaughter lies in a number of aspects such as the definition, the mindset of the accused, and lastly the sentence or punishment given to each. Keep on reading to grasp more about the differences.
Murder is the premeditated, intentional and, planned killing. It can also be classified as; (a) First-degree murder and, (b) Second-degree murder. For better understanding, First-degree murder is purely intentional and premeditated while second-degree murder is not premeditated. An example is when someone gets killed in the middle of a fight. It’s quite simple, right?
On the other hand, manslaughter can be defined as killing without premeditation. However, it can also be grouped as; (a) voluntary manslaughter and, (b) involuntary manslaughter. For better understanding, voluntary manslaughter is when the killing happens intentionally but still with no premeditation. Like when a man kills a wife in the process of an argument. Involuntary manslaughter is not intentional nor premeditated.
Sentences
It’s clear that the categories of killings range from first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and, involuntary manslaughter. This now brings the difference in charges given to each. First-degree murder is given the worst punishment while involuntary manslaughter is given the least severe charges.
