The Peoples Democratic Party has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress must explain how the reported 317 million litres of toxic fuel came into Nigeria, got cleared and distributed across the nation to worsen the life-discounting experiences of millions of Nigerians under the APC administration.
This was contained in a statement issued on Thursday by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, who also accused the FG of shielding those involved in the fiasco.
According to the opposition party, “the inclination for official concealment ostensibly informed the refusal by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, on national television on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, to name those involved in the importation of the poisonous fuel into the country.

“Apart from the consequential economic hardship occasioned by the damaging of cars and equipment, crippling of means of livelihood across the country as well as an increase in the cost of food items and essential services, the cascading effect of adulterated fuel on our aviation industry can only be imagined.
“Sadly, the situation can trigger loss of confidence by international airlines in our aviation fuel supply with attendant economic downturn as they would more likely prefer to fuel in neighbouring countries”.
It would be recalled that the FG had initiated a thorough investigation into the circumstances behind the distribution of adulterated petrol in the country.
Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, made the announcement following the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday while receiving questions from State House media.
The minister also said matters over damaged vehicles as a result of the “unusual” incident would also be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation but there were no conclusive plans yet on compensation.
