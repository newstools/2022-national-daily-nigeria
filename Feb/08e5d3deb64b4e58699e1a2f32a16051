Dr Tella Adeniran told members of the Online Media Practitioners of Nigeria (OMPAN) on a courtesy visit in Ado-Ekiti on Saturday.
He said election will take place across the 16 local government areas and 177 wards.
According to him, the commission has embarked on sensitisation and enlightenment campaign, which had always been on a continuous basis.
“We have met with civil society organisations and their responses have always been encouraging, so we normally keep them abreast of the events in the commission.
“We have also held a series of meetings and advocacy visits to traditional rulers and other towns and villages, while we still have it in the plan to regularly meet with other stakeholders to ensure the success of the poll.
“We, therefore, expect that you would also be ready to partner with the commission for the success, before, during and after the poll.”
