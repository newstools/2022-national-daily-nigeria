Another twist in Stamford Bridge after Roman Abramovich handed over Chelsea to six trustees as there has been a report of mass resignations.
Chelsea’s owner got wrapped up in the horrific Russian invasion of Ukraine and decided to step aside.
Chelsea fans love their club and their football and so they don’t understand all the drama that is going on right now.
Things moved quickly on Saturday night, as Roman Abramovich announced that he would step back from running the club, leaving it in the hands of the Chelsea charitable foundation’s trustees.

It was all a little light on detail, and the more we hear about it, the less sense it makes.
The Telegraph are now reporting that some of those six trustees are now considering resigning, presumably as they don’t necessarily want to be tied up and connected to what is likely to be a very sticky situation, both administratively and ethically.
The club insist there will be no hard feelings for anyone who decides they don’t want to be part of it, and they can continue to perform the duties they do now unchanged if they choose to resign as trustees.
Chelsea may go ahead with a smaller group of trustees, or rethink the pan entirely. There may be issues running a football club as part of a charity in any case.
So, what will happen to Chelsea if and when the six trustees resign?
