After all we have been through, God has been faithful.
Thank you for the overwhelming endorsement of our modest contributions to the growth of Lagos.
It can only get better for Lagos, and indeed Nigeria.
The youths are coming.
The power is in their hands.
Go and get your Permanent Voters Card (PVC) ready.
Your future is NOW!





Ambode in 2019, became the only Lagos state Governor since 1999 to lose his re-election campaign. He lost his party’s primary election to the incumbent Governor of the state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
