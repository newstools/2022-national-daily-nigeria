An Osun state high court sitting in Ikire, Irewole local government, has struck out the case instituted against the state congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
This came after six days the federal high court dismissed a similar case against the ward congress of the party.
It would be recalled that the interim national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) last week presented certificates of return to the chairman-elect of the party in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
The Prince Gboyega Famoodun, who is loyal to the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola, was recognized by the APC national body.

The suit was filed by Odetayo Olubunmi and Olanrewaju Esther, asking the court to invalidate the state congress that elected the Prince Gboyega Famodun-led State Executive and declare their faction as the authentic state officials of the party.
When the case came up Tuesday, counsel to the 6th defendant – APC, Mr Daud Akinloye, prayed the court to strike out the suit for lack of diligent prosecution.
His application was premised on the continued absence of the plaintiffs and/or their counsel as well as their refusal to serve the originating processes on the 1st to 5th defendants.
Justice Sikiru Oke, thereby struck out the case for lack of diligent prosecution.
meanwhile, the group loyal to the Minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola has vowed to continue with the fight, insisting that governor Gboyega Oyetola will not get a second term in the state.
