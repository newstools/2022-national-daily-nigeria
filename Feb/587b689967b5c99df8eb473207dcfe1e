The Federal Government has advised governors to explore gains the deployment of Fifth Generation Network (5G) will bring to their states and the Nigerian economy rather than gains from network operators.
Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Isa Pantami, gave the advice at a public workshop on National Policy on 5G Networks and Handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment in Abuja on Thursday.
Pantami urged the governors to look beyond the gains from right of way, which he said had become a challenge from time to time.

“I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit, the security benefits and many more of this technological advancement.
“It is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G,” he said.
He said, the adoption of 5G technology and rolling out its networks would support in the development of Nigeria’s digital economy.
According to him, 5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow them to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties.
“5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.
“Emerging technologies like blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.
“The World Economic Forum attests to the potential of blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.
“It can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,” he said.

“We use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we have been doing.”

The Executive Vice-Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, in his closing remarks thanked all the stakeholders for their contributions towards the deployment of 5G in the country.
