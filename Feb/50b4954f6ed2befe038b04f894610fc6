A 12-year- old girl (names withheld) in Ondo state has accused her 45- year- old father of repeatedly raping her.
The victim was said to have complained to one of the teachers at Saint Peter’s Primary School in Ondo West Local Government Area, who subsequently reported a case of child abuse at the Enu-Owa Police Division in Ondo town.
The victim reportedly informed police detectives that her father started defiling her last year.
It was learnt that the grandmother of the victim earlier took her from her father’s house when she suspected her son was sleeping with her.

A source quoted the victim as saying: “My mother died when I was six years old and since then I have been staying with my father. Some time ago, my grandmother came to pick me up from where my father and I were staying, to her house so that she can take care of me, but my father refused.
“When she took me by force, some days later, my father came to my grandmother’s house to fight her with a cutlass so she could release me to him to stay in his house.
“When my teacher noticed my way of doing things in school, she asked me what happened and I narrated my ordeal to her. So, the school authority called the police to arrest him.”
The teacher who pleaded anonymity said, “When I noticed that she had not been active as she used to be in class, even among her friends since the beginning of the term, I thought she was missing her mother or she was scolded by her father.
“But she continued to be lonely and left out. This made me invite her for interrogation and she told me what happened to her. She said her father used to sleep with her every night for a long time and has been threatening that she should not tell anyone if she does not want to die.”
But her father denied the accusation shortly after he was arrested.
