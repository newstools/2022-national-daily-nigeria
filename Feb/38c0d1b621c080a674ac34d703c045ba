An elder statesman, Chief Edwin Clark, on Thursday urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to quit the 2023 presidential race. The elder statesman said that the Igbo of southeast Nigeria should be allowed to produce the president in 2023. Clark, however, stated that if at all the president should come from the southwest, Tinubu is not the candidate, saying that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo or Governor Kayode Fayemi is a better candidate.
Edwin Clark, in an interview on ARISE TV monitored from Lagos by National Daily, questioned Tinubu’s contribution to national development, noting that he has been silent on the killings in the country and on the state of the nation.
Clark also questioned Tinubu’s political pedigree, saying that he is only popular in Lagos State, or by extension a few states in the southwest, but in other parts of the country.
According to Edwin Clark, “Tinubu should sit down. What does he want? If I am to vote, save for the Ibo, I will vote for the Vice President. He is a very intelligent person; he is articulate.
“If you are to talk of the southwest, I will consider the other one in Ekiti, the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi.”
The elder statesman was of the view that Osinbajo and Fayemi are better presidential aspirants from the southwest.
Clark berated Tinubu over perceived ‘silence of conspiracy’ on the prevailing insecurity and economic crisis in Nigeria.
“How many times did you hear Tinubu make a statement?
“how many times have you heard Tinubu talking about the killings in this nation?
“Have you heard Tinubu talk about the state of the nation?” Clark questioned. The elder statesman also expressed concerns about the age of Tinubu; he made a case for a younger and energetic president.
Edwin Clark appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the amended Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law to allow for transparent elections in 2023.
