According to National Daily report, Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, named Tunji Disu as the new head of the Intelligence Response Team—a unit of the Nigerian Police once led by the suspended Abba Kyari, but despite the replacement of kyari, he was wielding more power and influence than Disu, his supposed replacement. National Daily reports the NDLEA as saying that kyari recently led a team to arrest some traffickers, despite being under suspension.
This is one of the absurdities that render our institutions weak. How can you appoint Tunji Disu as kyari’s replacement and render him irrelevant? How can a man under suspension call the shots while his supposed successor is reduced to a powerless onlooker?
Suspension should be treated as such. You can’t be under suspension and still be calling the shots as head of police intelligence response squad, despite the appointment of a successor. Discipline is the soul of any working system. Allowing a suspended officer to continue to exert influence encourages impunity and indiscipline. The victim of this absurdity is not Tunji Disu, but the system or the institution.
The most dangerous threat to national security is the involvement of security officials in a crime or their association with criminal groups. When you have an army captain on the payroll of a kidnapping kingpin or a police officer hobnobbing with lawbreakers that he is supposed to fight, public safety and security are in great danger.
We have many fifth columnists who are frustrating the war against terrorism and banditry. Our security organizations need a thorough overhaul to weed out the bad apples. We can never be safe in a situation where security officials are in bed with criminals.
