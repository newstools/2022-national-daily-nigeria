While commending the funders and other partners in the advocacy, the governor assured the civil society groups that his administration would do everything possible in eradicating the menace.
Earlier, Dr Anna Ishaku, Wife of the Governor, expressed concern about the massive trafficking of children into slavery.
The first lady, who was represented by Mrs Bridget Twar, Commissioner for Social Development, said that Cameroon-Nigerian border had served as trafficking route of persons and children from neighbouring local government areas.
