The four Russian Bear jets were “intercepted and escorted” away from the UK airspace by two British Typhoon jets on Wednesday afternoon, the RAF has now confirmed

Four Russian jets have been “intercepted and escorted” away from the UK airspace after approaching the north of Scotland, the Royal Air Force has confirmed.
British Typhoon jets were scrambled to turn away the four Russian Bear aircraft as they approached a “UK area of interest”.
The RAF has confirmed that the Russian jets did not enter UK airspace before they were turned around
The Russian jets that were intercepted were Tu-95 – a large four-engine turboprop-powered strategic bomber and missile platform.
Jets had been scrambled to intercept unknown aircraft in a ‘Quick Reaction Alert’ mission after the Russian planes were spotted.
The British fighters from RAF Lossiemouth were supported by a Voyager Tanker from RAF Brize Norton.
Earlier today a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon fighters from RAF Lossiemouth, supported by a Voyager Tanker from RAF Brize Norton, have been launched against unidentified aircraft approaching the UK area of interest.
“We will not be offering any additional detail on this ongoing operation until complete.”

British jets were scrambled to remove the jets
The RAF has previously been vocal on the measures it takes to ensure Russian military aircraft entering the UK Flight Information Region are monitored.
The reason it is controlled as it is the UK’s controlled zone of international airspace and unannounced air traffic can be a hazard to other air users.
To make matters even more problematic for UK air controllers, Russian jets have reportedly not communicated with air traffic control to ensure they are visible to other air users and air traffic controllers on the ground in the past.
