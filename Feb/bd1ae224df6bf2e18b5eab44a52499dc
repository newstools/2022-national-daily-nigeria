There are indications that the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, might have gone into hiding after Russia invaded the country on Thursday. In place of a public broadcast to reassure the people of the government capability to defend the country, the Ukraine president posted a video message on Facebook, through which he proclaimed martial law after the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday by Russia.  Zelensky noting that Russia attacked the country’s “military infrastructure” and border guards, encouraged citizens not to panic, promising them victory.
Zelensky in the video message posted on Facebook after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a military operation against Ukraine, proclaimed martial law in the country, informing citizens that he has engaged US President Joe Biden in telephone conversation.

Zelensky in another message posted on the presidential website highlighted: “This morning, Russia launched a new military operation against our state.
“This is a completely groundless, cynical invasion.
“We, the citizens of Ukraine, have been determining our own future since 1991.
“But now, what is being decided is not only our country’s future, but also the future of how Europe will live.”
Zelensky in subsequent security action, not only ordered the deployment of the 250,000 military force of the country but also directed the recall of the reserves and retirees. This, however, looked like no threat to Russia which has over one million military might.
