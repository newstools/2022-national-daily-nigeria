Former US President, Donald Trump, has begun preparations for a comeback to the White House in 2024.
Trump at a rally in Texas on Saturday, revealed to Americans his ability to dominate the political conversation, generating controversy on his comeback ambition.
Trump was surrounded by “Trump Won” flags at a rally on Saturday in Texas, where he disclosed his intension to contest for president again in 2024.
Trump protested that those charged in the assault over the 2020 mob invasion of the US Capitol, by the FBI as an act of domestic terror, were being “treated so unfairly”; he declared, “if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons.”
The former 75-year-old former US President and property magnate instigated his followers to embark on “the biggest protests we have ever had” if the prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal.”
Trump also argued that next day that his vice president Mike Pence could have rejected President Joe Biden’s victories in some crucial battleground states.
“Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!” Trump had declared.
Trump reiterated that he was the winner of the 2020 election.
