The Niger State Government and Kitovu Technology Company on Thursday inaugurated a project to enable farmers to store their produce.
The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Ibrahim Panti, said the project would enable farmers to preserve their produce and sell whenever they want.
Kitovu is an agriculture-focused technology company that uses data to supply chain inefficiencies in African agriculture, enabling farmers to make more money through increased yields and access to markets.
Panti advised farmers, especially small holder farmers, to take advantage of the project to store their produce to sell later and earn more when prices increase.
He said that the state government was ready to partner with individual or corporate entity to support farmers, assuring that the project would be adequately monitored to the benefit of farmers.
In her remarks, Mrs Beatrice Benjamin, the coordinator of the project, said that it was designed to reach out to farmers in the grassroots.
“This project is to assist small holder farmers to meet up with the current trends in the society to have maximum yield,” she said.
Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer, Kitovu technology, Mr Nwachinemere Emeka, said that the project was a modern storage system for farmers across the state to help to reduce mass loss of produce.
Emeka said that measures had been put in place to ensure that grains quality was maintained while in stores.
Malam Yusuf Gunduma, a farmer, appreciated the initiative and appealed to government to also come up with modern facilities for yam storage.
