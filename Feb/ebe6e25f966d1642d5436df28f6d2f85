A well known Nigerian politician, Joe Igbokwe who was the spokesperson of All Progressive Congress (APC), Lagos State chapter, and chieftain has taken to his official Facebook page to react after some prominent personality from the Southeastern Nigeria, under the aegis of Igbo Elders Consultative Forum (IECF), threatened that the Igbos will leave the country if the 2023 Presidency is not given to the Southern region.
According to information gathered from a reliable source, some outstanding personality from the Southeastern Nigeria, under the aegis of Igbo Elders Consultative Forum (IECF), has threatened that the Igbos will quit the country if they are not given the opportunity to participate in the 2023 Presidential election, adding that no Southerner has been President of Nigeria since the fourth dispensation began in 1999.

Based on these notes, the exceptionally boisterous APC supporter, and special adviser to the Lagos State governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, on drainage and water resources, Joe Igbokwe made it known that before the Presidency would be given to the South East, they have to consult, build bridges, meet other Nigerians, and preach unity not division.

This is a good one from Joe Igbokwe, and if you ask me, I would say that I fully support him on this one. If the Southerners wants to participate in the 2023 Presidential election, then they should be ready to embrace peace, and having the mindset of division.
What is your view on this?.
