Lagos State Government has shut down a private school, Unic Vilos Montessori School, Maza Maza, after a teacher in the school, Miss Joy Igile, flogged a two-year-old, Cherish Ohamadike, inflicting injuries with marks on the back of the child.
The Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo, had emphasised that the school is located within the elementary level, and as such the ministry of education ordered the sealing of the school after confirming the incidence of corporal punishment by the teacher.
The commissioner revealed that Unic Vilos Montessori School has been operating without approval. Folashade Adefisayo maintained that the State Government is extending its activities to shut down other illegal schools in the state.
The parents of the victim disclosed that a combined team of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, the Domestic Violence and Response Unit, and the Ministry of Youths and Social Development, arrested the teacher and proprietress on Monday. The proprietress was said to have been released, but the teacher is still in detention.
