Borno Governor Babagana Zulum stated this while expressing hope of the insurgency ending during his administration.
He was at the Villa Thursday to brig President Muhammadu Buhari up to speed on the military operation in the state.
Zulum also debunked claims of any incentives, saying the Borno State government does not offer any incentive to the fighters to come out of the forests, rather, they have done so voluntarily.
The governor who had earlier warned that ISWAP was gaining ground in the North East, told State House Correspondents that he discussed the continuing surrender of the insurgents and the case of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with the President.
He also suggested the federal government should consider hiring mercenaries to combat the terrorists.
