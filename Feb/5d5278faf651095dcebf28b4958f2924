Manchester City is eyeing a Champions League title this term after last season’s final day collapse. The Manchester club under Pep Guardiola won’t allow repeating that mistake as the round of 16 is on the way. And the Spaniard manager has named four clubs he feels have a chance to win this season UCL title.

Guardiola feels Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, and Ajax are the clubs that have equal chances to shine this term. Bayern Munich is doing well in Bundesliga and they will rock in the UCL this time. The German side has been at the par in the Champions League and they have turned it to be their favorite title.
Ajax and Liverpool are there to stop any club that has ambitions to win this season’s title. Erik Ten Hag is full of surprises and he is in UCL to compete. Klopp on his side wants to win the UCL as the PL seems to be in City’s hands.
And ours is to wait and see who will make it to the final and win the title ahead of other top clubs in Europe.
