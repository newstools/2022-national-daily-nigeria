Leeds’ failure to begin contract talks with star midfielder Kalvin Phillips has a number of clubs on red alert.


The England international’s current deal runs out in 2024 and he is keen on signing a new one at his boyhood club.


West Ham had a £50million bid rejected in January and more approaches may come once the season ends.


According to 90min, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle are all eager to sign Phillips.


Injury has limited the 26-year-old to just 12 Premier League appearances this campaign but he shone for Leeds last term and for England at Euro 2020.


Although he got a pay rise when the Whites were promoted, the report suggests his salary is still some way below the likes of Raphinha and Rodrigo.


His agent Kevin Sharp told the Daily Star recently that the Leeds-born maestro is focused on remaining at Elland Road.


He said: “Kalvin was pleased that Leeds turned those offers down. He has never asked to leave Leeds in all his time with the club and has no intention of doing that now or in the summer.


“So I would hope that Leeds would honour their promise of a new contract for him which would then end any unsettling speculation about his future this summer.”
