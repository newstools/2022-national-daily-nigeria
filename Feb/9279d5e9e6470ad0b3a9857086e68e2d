The Ogun State Police Command has launched a massive manhunt for some youths who set ablaze two men found with a human head in Oja Odan, Yewa North Local Government Area of the State on Saturday
Recall that the two men, Idowu Afolabi and Johnson Adebiyi, were detained at Oja Odan police station for having a fresh human head in their possession.
But, the youths stormed the police station, broke in and dragged out the two suspects, whom they set on fire in front of the station.
Reacting to the incident, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole in a statement by the spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said there will be no room for jungle justice in the state, warning the general public that “such barbaric and unlawful action will no longer be tolerated.”

He said, “While the suspects were being interrogated in the station, some unscrupulous elements went and mobilized a large number of people who invaded the station aggressively, overwhelmed the police personnel on duty and subsequently hijacked the suspects, beat them to death and set their corpses ablaze.”
Sounding a note of warning, Oyeyemi told those in the habit of taking laws into their hands to desist from such “uncivilized behaviour” as the command will henceforth “deal with whoever carries out such actions in the most decisive manner.”
The PPRO maintained that “a suspect remains a suspect until he/she is convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction, no matter how grievous the crime he is suspected to have committed might be.”
He explained that “It is only the court that has the power to impose punishment on anyone found guilty of a crime, not an individual or group of people.”
The CP also appealed to members of the public to have confidence in the nation’s criminal justice system and desist from self-help, saying such is alien to the law of the land.
