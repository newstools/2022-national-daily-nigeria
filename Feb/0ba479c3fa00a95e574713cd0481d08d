In the recent video that surfaced on the official instagram page of pulsenigeria247, a man was seen eating on the bus. The food that the young man was eating is called ‘Eba’ which is mainly eaten in the west African sub-region, particularly in Nigeria. Moreover, the food is specifically called Eba by the Yoruba people.
The young man looks so confident, as he placed the food on his lap without minding the people that sat next to him.
Pulsenigeria247 also captioned the video saying; “this guy will make everyone on the bus salivate”.

The most common food that travellers usually eat, are biscuit, chin chin, and bread. Because spicy food usually cause discomfort to people on public transport.
There’s no denying that, as a nation, we seem to have some issues with people eating on public transport.
