Information minister, Lai Mohammed said the Muhammadu Buhari regime is fronting the quest to regulate social media around the world.
His comments came hours after a video depicting Bola Tinubu‘s soaked dress and probable odour dominated discussion across social media on Sunday. The minister also noted the regime’s engagement with Twitter after the government blocked Nigerians‘ access to the microblogging site in June 2021.
“In this area, I can confidently say we are far ahead of most countries in the world, who have now realised that social media must be regulated in the interest of their own people,”  he said to a group of reporters.
Mohammed said the successful negotiation with Twitter on measures to ensure a responsible use of the platform had placed Nigeria as a global trailblazer in efforts to prevent harmful content from social media platforms.
He reassured that the conditions and measures agreed upon for lifting the ban on Twitter would also be applied to other social media platforms operating in the country.
