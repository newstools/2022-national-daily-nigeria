President Vladimir Putin of Russian on Sunday sent a strong warning to the United States (US) and NATO, directing Russian defence chiefs to place the nuclear “deterrence forces” on high alert. He denounced the aggression of the West, berating them for taking “unfriendly” steps against Russia. At the inchoate stage of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had warned the West over their threats to Russian security that they should not forget Russia is a nuclear power. Putin had also warned that Russia would respond immediately to any international interference in the Ukraine war.
As NATO members at their meeting in Brussel last Thursday resolved to active their Response Forces against Russia, Putin ordered the movement of the country’s nuclear weapons  in readiness for war with the West.
The U.S. President, Joe Biden had declared that Putin’s order for nuclear war is unacceptable.
Putin had declared: “I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces to put the deterrence forces of the Russian army into a special mode of combat service.
“You see that Western countries are not only unfriendly to our country in the economic sphere — I mean illegitimate sanctions.
“Senior officials of leading NATO countries also allow aggressive statements against our country.”
Defence Minister Shoigu was said to have replied: “Affirmative.”
There are rising fears that the war in Ukraine will be become dangerous and destructive at the stage of deploying nuclear weapons.
