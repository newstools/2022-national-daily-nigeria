In a report the DIG Joseph Egbunike-led panel submitted to IGP, te suspended police officer said IPOB and ESN were after him because of his work as the commander of the IGP Intelligence Response Team.
“It is a campaign to smear his reputation by members of IPOB/ESN who vowed to destroy him, due to his onslaught against them in the South East,” the report quoted Kyari as saying.
The FBI busted a crime ring headed by Ramon Abbas, a Nigerian based in the UAE, and traced the ring’s connection to Kyari.
How the IPOB featured in it was not clear.
The panel however dismissed the defence, and recommended suspension and rank reduction.
It rather indicted him for violating the Nigerian police social media rules, and of buddying up with Abbas aka Hushpuppi.
But on reviewing the report, AG Abubakar Malami insisted Kyari has a prima facie criminal case to answer.
The FBI has been discussing the possibility of handing over Kyari to face allegation I the US court because the Abbas ring committed some of the fraud in the US.
But the latest arrest and possible arraignment of Kyari by the NDLEA for drug trafficking might have put paid to the possibility of Kyari facing prosecution in the US.
The narc agency arrested Kyari after catching him red-handed in a sting operation where he brokered a $61,000 coke deal with the agency undercover operatives.
