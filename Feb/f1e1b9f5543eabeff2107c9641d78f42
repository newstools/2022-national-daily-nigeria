International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun discussion of a second review of the current cooperation programme with Ukraine.
IMF Resident Representative in Ukraine, Vahram Stepanyan, made this known on Wednesday.
In November, the IMF approved an extension of the 18-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with Ukraine to the end of June 2022 as well as a rephasing of programme disbursements.
“The IMF mission, headed by Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, begins discussions today with the Ukrainian authorities on the second revision of the IMF-supported programme. Mission meetings will be held online,” Stepanyan said as quoted by the press service.
In June 2020, the highest decision-making body of the IMF, the Board of Governors, approved a new cooperation programme for Ukraine.
Ukraine was expected to receive a total of 5 billion dollars under the new programme.
The country has already received two tranches worth about 2.8 billion dollars.
