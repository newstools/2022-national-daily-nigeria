Ahead of its 26 February, 2022 National Convention, the caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has inaugurated state executives of the party for 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory.
Kano and Sokoto states, however, have their party chairmen not inaugurated in an event that took place in Abuja on Thursday.
The decision not to inaugurate the excos for the two states may not be unconnected with the crisis rocking the party in the affected states.
The list of state chairmen inaugurated on Thursday include; Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu (Abia), Alh Ibrahim Bilal (Adamawa), Mr Augustine Enefiok Ekanem (Akwa Ibom), Hon Basil Ejike (Anambra), Alh Babayo Aliyu Misau (Bauchi), Dr. Dennis Otiotio (Bayelsa), Mr Augustine Agada (Benue), Hon. Ali Bukar Dalori (Borno), and Mr. Alphonsus Orgar Eba Esq. (Cross River).
