Mr Sunday Ajimoko, Chairman, Oye Local Government Council in Ekiti State, plans to increase Internally-Generated Revenue so as to provide employment opportunities.

The chairman noted that he had set up a committee to look inward and make recommendations on how his goals could be achieved.
“I have set up a committee to look inward and make recommendations on how the local government can generate funds to execute community services, improve infrastructure and create employment opportunities.
“Currently, our allocation is not enough to carry out any meaningful project in any community.
“We are working tirelessly to find better means of increasing our IGR to serve as backup to the allocation we are receiving from the Federal Government,’’ he said.
Ajimoko appealed to the local council workers to be punctual at their various offices and assured that they’d get all their entitlements promptly,’’
