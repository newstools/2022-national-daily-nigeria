Reverend Father Joseph Shekari who was kidnapped by gunmen has regained freedom after 48 hours in captivity.
The Chancellor of Kafanchan Catholic Diocese, Reverend Father Emmanuel Okolo confirmed the release to reporters.
He said Reverend Father Shekari was released at about 10:00 pm on Monday night.
Okolo however, did not state if any ransom was paid to the gunmen or not before they released the Reverend Father.
He appreciated those who offered prayers for the quick release of the priest and prayed for the repose of the soul of the cook who was killed during the kidnap.
The bandits on Sunday night stormed St. Monica’s Catholic Church, Parish, in Ikulu Pari of Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State and made way with the priest.
The gunmen also killed the Reverend Father’s cook, who is a secondary school student, before taking the priest away to an unknown destination.
It was also reported that the gunmen carted away an unspecified amount of money realised from a thanksgiving service on that Sunday.
