Controversial Nigerian activist, Omoyele Sowore has revealed that All Progressives Congress national leader, Bola Tinubu was flown to London in an air ambulance. The Sahara Repoters’ owner made the claim on a Facebook post noting that the erstwhile Lagos state governor’s presidential ambition is dead on arrival.




Tinubu recently informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to contest in the 2023 presidential election. The former governor of Lagos State, however, said he was consulting with relevant stakeholders across the country. But, last week, the APC National Leader traveled to London, where he is running his presidential campaign.
Dismissing Tinubu’s claim, Sowore, in a Facebook post, wrote: “Three weeks ago you would think the election had been decided when Jagaban of Corruption, Bola Tinubu “declared” his intention to run but soon as he discovered that his ambition was dead on arrival, he took his ambulance and fled to London!.
