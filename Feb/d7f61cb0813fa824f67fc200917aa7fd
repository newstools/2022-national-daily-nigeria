As the discussions about the 2023 general elections in the Federal Republic of Nigeria gains more political attentions from prominent political strategists, critical individuals, opinion moulders, pressure groups and concerned citizens, it is better to look at the possible political chances of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to perform better in some of the states with bulk number of votes, using the 2019 presidential election results.
Following the results of the 2019 presidential election results across the 774 Local Government Areas in the country, the cumulative results of votes cast in Lagos State, Southwestern part of the country, and Kaduna State, from Northwestern part of Nigeria, is convincingly among the states with huge voting strength. However, the main opposition party in the country, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), may suffer critical political rift in those two States, during the 2023 general elections. Let us look into this observation, collectively:
1. Lagos State
The political contest for the Governorship ticket of PDP in Lagos State, for the 2023 Governorship election in the State may be a dog and tiger situation between those members of PDP that believe in using one of the aggrieved Tinubu’s boys and those that may retain their support for the 2019 Governorship candidate of PDP in the State, Jimi Agbaje.
Remarkably, according to Lagos State Electoral Collation Officer in 2019, Prof F. K Salako there were total Number of 6,313,507 registered voters; 1,196,490 were accredited to vote; total number of votes cast stood at 1,156,590.
Of the total votes cast, 1,089,567 were valid while rejected votes stood at 67,023.
The breakdown of party’s performances were given as:
AAC: 8,910
ADC: 2,915
ADP: 1,262
APC: 580,825
PDP: 448,015
SDP: 770
Looking at this and the uncertain political future that awaits the choice of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the course of chosing the Governorship candidate of the party for Lagos State Governorship poll in 2023, Lagos State could be considered to be among states with bulk votes where PDP may be enmeshed in severe political crisis.
2. Kaduna State

The political contest for the Governorship ticket of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the 2023 Governorship election in the state may be a cat and rat contest between the political followers of Senator Shehu Sani and the Kaduna State governorship candidate in 2019 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon Isa Kudan Ashiru.
Remarkably, according to the INEC Collation Officer for Kaduna State in 2019, Prof. B. B Shehu, the state had total registered voters of 3, 861,033 with 1,757,868 accredited to vote. Total number of 1,709,005 cast their votes; as 1,663,603 votes were declared valid while 45,402 votes were rejected.
The performance by each political party that took part in the election stood at:
AAC: 243
ADC: 558
ADP: 227
APC: 993,445
PDP: 649,612
SDP: 1,737
Sincerely, with this results and the political futures that face PDP in both Lagos and Kaduna State, regarding the choice of their Governorship candidate, the party may be expected to suffer huge political rift, unfortunately, in those two States with bulk voting capacities.
