The upcoming presidential election has sparked interest since many top politicians, including Dave Umahi, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Orji Uzor Kalu, and Rochas Okorocha, declared their intention to run, and everyone is waiting for the primary election to find out their fate.
The former Governor of Lagos State, whom many people have tagged as the favorite man to become the APC flag bearer due to how well accepted and popular he is across the country, is currently consulting across Nigeria to create awareness. But some APC cabals that the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Buni, leads are making some moves which may affect the chance of Tinubu in the 2023 election if care is not taken.
Some hours ago, the APC cabals, led by Mai Buni, sought the postponement of the party convention that had already been scheduled for the 26th of this month, a demand that has been okayed by President Muhammadu Buhari.

This may affect Tinubu, as it is believed that the Cabals make that move for some giant politicians who people are pushing to enter the presidential race, like Osinbajo or Rotimi Amaechi, to declare their intention of running for President.
With this postponement, the people I mentioned above will have time to think about whether they should join the presidential race or not. If they declare their intention, it would reduce Tinubu’s sagacity and affect his chance of becoming party flag bearer.
Another move by the APC cabals led by Mai Buni is how they plan to stop the senators and representative members from voting in the primary election. If this move is successful, it will undoubtedly have an impact on Tinubu because many of the representatives and senators targeted by the Cabals have already declared their support for Tinubu and are among those on whom Tinubu relies in the Presidential race.
