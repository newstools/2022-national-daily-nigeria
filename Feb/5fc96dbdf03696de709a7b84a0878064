Weeks after some media reported that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu may not get a second term ticket from the All Progressives Congress following some arrangements in the state, one of the tipped candidates, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, Head of Service has disassociated himself from the plot to unseat the governor.
It would be recalled that National Daily had earlier published a report where it said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s second term as Lagos governor is not certain and may face what his predecessor, Akinwummi Ambode battled with.
The report stated that power tussle between Christians and Muslims in Lagos state may not allow the governor to go for another term since he would be completing the eight year tenure allotted to the Christians after the administration of Babatunde Raji Fashola.
It was also gathered that certain individuals are pushing for a Muslim governor in 2023 and it may likely become a reality, and that Hakeem Muri-Okunola has been chosen as their candidate.

But in a statement on Sunday, Hakeem Muri-Okunola said his attention has been drawn to several publications linking him with a fictitious race for Lagos State Governor and plots to stop Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s second term bid.
“I hereby dissociate myself from all publications and innuendoes conveying such plots. I reiterate my support for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his administration’s THEMES Agenda – the six-pillar development plan that is the compass for his projects and policies.
“The objective of those behind these publications is obviously to plant a seed of discord between Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and me. Contrary to the statements being published by mischief makers, who are also trying to play the religion card, I am fully focused on carrying out my duties as Head of Service of the Lagos State Government and taking the Public Service to greater heights,” he added.
