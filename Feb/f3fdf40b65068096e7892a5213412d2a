Speaking on the matter, Mr. Gbenga stressed that Kyari should have kept a low profile life considering the fact that he is already indicted in a multi-million dollar cybercrime, adding that his audacious activities which led to his arrest as an alleged drug trafficker is enough proof that corruption has eaten deep into the system.
The chieftain made it known that it’s because criminals no longer recognize the power and presence of the Nigerian government that’s why they act the way they do, as he went further to highlight other social vices that are pervading the country lately.
