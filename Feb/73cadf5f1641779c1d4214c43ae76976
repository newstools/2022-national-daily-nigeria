20-year-old Moses Oko, who was arrested for the gruesome murder of a 300-level University of Jos student, Jennifer Anthony, has been arraigned in a high court in Plateau State.
Recall that National Daily report how the 20-year-old said to be the boyfriend of the deceased, lured her into a hotel where she was brutally murdered. Jennifer’s mutilated body was found in a hotel in Jos with her eyes plucked out and other vital body parts missing.
The victim
The suspect was arraigned by the police before the Plateau State High Court presided over by Hon. Justice S. P. Gang, on Monday, February 21.
Daily Trust reports that the suspect was led into the court and had a quiet session with his counsel before his parents later joined them.

However, drama started as soon as the case file of the suspect was called and he was asked to move into the witness box to take an oath.
On reaching the witness box, the court clerk called his name to know if he understood the English language or Hausa language, so as to know how to administer the oath for him, but he did not respond and instead kept starring at the court without uttering a word.
Everyone in the court was baffled as the court clerk called him several times but he did not respond.
In his explanation, Counsel for the defendant N. E Jesse (Esq) told the Court that Oko was not mentally stable, as his senses fluctuates.
“It appears the weight of charges slammed on him is too heavy for him to bear and as a result has developed imbalanced mental conditions,” Oko’s Lawyer said.
Reacting to Jesse (Esq) submission, Muleng Alex (Esq), Counsel for the Prosecution told the court that the medical report before the court shows otherwise.
Muleng claimed that the defendant spoke very well to his Counsel in English language before the matter was called.
