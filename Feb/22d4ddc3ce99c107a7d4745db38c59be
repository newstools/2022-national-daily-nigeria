Without a doubt, ever since Sanwo Olu came to power after defeating the PDP in 2019, he has been building the state with infrastructures and other achievements that make him one of the best governors in the country.

Babajide Sanwo Olu’s uncountable achievements, combined with the fact that he has a giant politician on his side, like former Governor of the state Bola Tinubu, will make him difficult to defeat in the upcoming election. However, these are the 3 politicians that will give him a tough time or take over his power if care is not taken.
Akinwunmi Ambode:
This former Governor of Lagos State, who came to power in 2014 but denies running for a second term, may come back with full force in the upcoming election, as the PDP is currently attempting to lure him to their party in order to take over the gubernatorial seat from the APC.
However, Ambode is no longer a new face in Nigeria, as he is also widely accepted and liked by the people of Lagos. If Ambode decides to run, there is a high chance he won’t be an easy task for Sanwo Olu. Also, his recent statements where he urged people to get their PVC indicate that he may run.

Jimi Agbaje:
Jimi Agbaje is also one of the respected politicians in Lagos, as he has been eyeing the gubernatorial seat for a long time, but he is being defeated. Jimi, who might have not given up on his governorship ambitions, may decide to run in 2023 as well.
Jimi Agbaje, who would have learned from his defeat in the previous election, may come back stronger this time, and he may also receive sympathy votes from many of his supporters across the state who believe he has something better to offer the state.
