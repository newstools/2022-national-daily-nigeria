Two international NGOs, Rossy Foundation, Germany and Heart of Gold Charity Foundation, Austria are collaborating to assist in improving quality education in the country.
Mr Ofoma Chichetam, who represented the foundations, told newsmen in Abuja on Thursday that the collaboration became essential in order to ensure standard in secondary school education in the country.
He said the foundations organised a quiz competition among Secondary School students in Imo in January through the State Senior Secondary Education Management Board and Ministry of Education.
“The winners of the quiz competition are Holy Ghost College Owerri, the first runner up was Government College Owerri while the second runner up was Akwakuma Girls Secondary School Owerri.
“Five schools participated in the quiz competition in Imo and a total of six subjects which are Mathematics; English language; Physics; Chemistry; Biology and Economics were up for the quiz.
“The partnership was borne out of special love and desire for quality education, to promote and sustain overall academic performance among students in the country.
“The two NGOs were ready and committed for such educational empowerment across the country.
“However, a prize of N250,000 was usually up for grab for the students as support for academic performance and to encourage them to put more efforts in their academics,’’ Chichetam said.
He further said that the first runner up usually gets a prize of N200,000 for excellence in academics while the 2nd runner up gets a prize of N150,000 for hard work and success in the quiz.
