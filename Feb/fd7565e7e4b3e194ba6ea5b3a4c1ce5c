The medical doctor wrote: “I just want to thank God that the child my parents adopted didn’t turn me and my siblings to orphans.
She poured one of those sniper-like chemicals into their beverages because they said she should be apologising when she’s wrong.”
She continued: “The heart of a man is desperately wicked, yes, including children.
“This is a child that my sister and I will take it upon ourselves to fight for her when we think our parents are being too hard on her. So many times my mother especially will fight me because I’m interfering.”
She later explained how the 10-year-old tried to execute her plans. She wrote:
“After my dad took like 2 spoons he noticed it had a smell, with intuition he suspected what had happened. He asked her the next day and she admitted it. She was home alone all day”
The medical doctor stated that her parents have since taken the young lady back to her hometown.
