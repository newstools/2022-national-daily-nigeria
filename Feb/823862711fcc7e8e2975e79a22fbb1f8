Reports have it that there were blasts and explosions in cities of Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that his country will begin a military operation in eastern Ukraine. Consequently, we have stated some possible reasons why Russia has decided to carry out the military operation despite threats of severe sanctions from the US and many European nations.
1) To stop Ukraine from joining NATO
According to report, NATO which means the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is an intergovernmental military alliance whose aim is “to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means”.
We believe that Russia sees Ukraine joining NATO as a threat to its borders. That is because it will allow the NATO member nations which include the US to set up a military base close to their border. Russia doesn’t want that as there has always been a lack of trust between them and the US.
2) To effect a regime change in Ukraine
Another possible reason why they are carrying out the invasion may be to effect a regime change in Ukraine. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in support of his country joining NATO. One way Russia could stop that could be to take control of Ukraine and install someone that doesn’t have the same visions as Zelenskyy as President.
3) To expand their territory
Before commencing the invasion, Russia first announced that they have recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic in Eastern Ukraine as independent states.
Therefore, one of the reasons for their invasion of Ukraine could be to install leaders in the two “independent states” who will then be their allies. That will reduce the territory NATO will occupy if Ukraine eventually succeeds in joining them.
