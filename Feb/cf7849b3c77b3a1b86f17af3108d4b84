Sen. Minority Leader Eyinanya Abaribe revealed this at the investiture of Jasper Nduagwuike as the 16th president of the Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture on Saturday.
According to the senator, Kanu distanced himself from the order when the IPOB leader received him,  Senator Ike Ekweremadu, and two Bishops at the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS.
“He told us ‘I have never said people should sit at home’. I told him that nobody believed you,” Abaribe said.
“There is no way we are going to survive like this. You are sitting at home and the people who you are doing these things for are in Lagos and Abuja and they don’t care. And you are here killing your own.”
He cited other countries like Spain and its economic capital Catalonia in a similar secessionist crisis.
“Even if you seek a separate country, why would you destroy your own place with your hands? You need to have a viable country and not a scattered one.”
Kanu’s denial and what his group does cannot be reconciled.
IPOB declares a sit-at-home order whenever Kanu is appearing in court as he continues his terrorism trial in a federal high court in Abuja.
The group has, however, insisted it cancelled the Monday order it proclaimed last year.
Parts of the group enforcing the order do it with violence and destruction of lives and properties, beside the overhanging fear of carrying out economic activities Mondays.
