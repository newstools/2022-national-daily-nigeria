Jack Obinyan, a former media aide to the executive governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki has reacted to the trending video where the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari was allegedly spotted, giving bribe to an undercover security agent over a drug deal, carried out by an international drug syndicate in which the DCP is an alleged member.
In the post he made on his verified Facebook page a while ago, the Edo-born politician, after watching the video clip, wondered how DCP Abba Kyari is going to explain, and get himself out of the troubles he is currently in. How is he going to explain this, Jack questions nobody in particular in the post. You can watch the video clip here.
In the video clip shared by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as part of evidences for arresting Kyari, the out-of-favor Police Officer was seen having a monetary discussion with a man that can be easily linked to bribery in a vehicle. Check out the post from Jack Obinyan below:

Recall that shortly after DCP Abba Kyari, who is still under suspension for having links with Hushpuppi, a certified international cyber criminal was declared wanted by NDLEA, he was arrested and detained by the agency.
