Prof. Peter Adeoye of the Department of Surgery, University of Ilorin, has appealed to the Federal Government to establish Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine Centre at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH).
Adeoye made the call on Thursday night in Ilorin during his paper presentation at the 216th Inaugural Lecture of the University of Ilorin.
His paper was entitled: “Battling to keep our hearts: Who will heal the bleeding hearts; innovation in the practice of cardiothoracic surgery”.
The don stated that the basic tripod on which cancer treatment stands are surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The cardiologist, who teaches in the Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Health Sciences of the UITH, observed that for a meaningful outcome, there must be a well-planned regimen encompassing the three modalities.
He lamented that patients who were operated on at the UITH have to wait for appointments in Ibadan, Abuja, Lagos, Zaria or Sokoto.
“It is therefore of paramount importance and a matter of urgency to have Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine established at our institution,” he said.
Adeoye also called for improved facilities and sub-specialisation in Histopathology.
According to him, sub-specialisation will prove promptness and accuracy in identifying disease conditions, especially of cancers.
He further advised on improved funding of cancer research, adding that many cancers still have grey areas and yet to be identified etiologic factors, particularly in the environment.
