Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, former Governor of Abia State, at the weekend declared that he lost nothing going to prison, saying that though he was innocent but he learnt a lot while in prison.
Orji Uzor Kalu, representing Abia North Senatorial District in the National Assembly, and Chief Whip of the Senate, at the weekend said that the prison is a learning institution.
According to Kalu, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 general elections, “I am not guilty, I am as free as anything.
“They put me in prison to the glory of God and Nigerian people should thank them because I am better off today being there.
“I lost nothing, I went there to learn, it was a learning institution, and every politician and every civil servant needs to go there and learn; they will have another perspective of life.”
Orji Kalu speaking on Channels Television, monitored by National Daily from Lagos, alleged that certain political actors in addition to a former president, instigated his imprisonment which was later upturned by the court.
“The average Nigerian knows that I have committed no offence.
“There were 19 witnesses in court, and nobody mentioned my name, and somebody paid somebody to put me in jail for six months, and I thank God I went.
“It was a glorious thing; that is the best thing God has ever done to me, to be able to put me in the lowest end of the world. “Mind you, I was meant to be in Wuhan on December 9, 2019, and the people put me in jail on December 5; it is to the glory of God,” Kalu had declared.
