Justice Lewis Allagoa of the Federal High Court Lagos, on Monday frowned at attitude of lawyers who derived pleasure in filing “silly and frivolous applications” for the purpose of stalling the trial of N22. 4billion trapped investors funds in the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.

The judge, who observed that instead of lawyers allowing the 14 years old case of trapped investors money being heard and determined on merit, most of them are busy filing same motions that had earlier been filed and dealt with by the high Court, Court of Appeal, up to the Supreme Court.

He made the observation while delivering ruling in an application seeking discontinuation of the case of Barrister Debo Adeleke led 13, 741 inestors brought before the court by Nospetco Oil and Gas.

“I think lawyers should work to the satisfaction of the interest of Justice. The Investors money is crying for collection and you busy yourselves filing silly applications, wearing wigs and gowns, riding in expensive cars while the investors of the trapped funds are suffering and dying”, the judge observed.

Justice Allagoa however granted an application seeking striking out of names of Rowland Badejo, and three other investors who had earlier filed an application for discontinuance of the suit, saying it should continue.
