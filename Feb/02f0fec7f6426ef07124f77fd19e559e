An Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court on Thursday sentenced a 39-year-old driver, Abiodun Matthew, to life imprisonment for defiling a pupil of University of Lagos (UNILAG) Women Society School.
Matthew, who was charged with sexual assault by penetration, was the school’s driver, while the survivor was a four-year-old pupil.
Justice Abiola Soladoye sentenced Matthew after establishing that the prosecution, who had presented four witnesses in the trial, proved the case against the convict beyond reasonable doubt.
“The defendant’s defence of alibi does not fly. He’s stating that he was elsewhere when the act occurred is false as he was busy fiddling with the private part of the victim.
“The defendant having been found guilty as charged under Section 261 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment with no option of fine.
“His name is to be entered into the Sexual Offenders Register maintained by the Lagos State Government,” she said.
NAN reports that according to the Lagos State Government’s prosecution team; Mr Olusola Soneye, Mrs Olufunke Adegoke and Ms Abimbola Abolade, the convict committed the offence on March 23, 2019.
He sexually assaulted the pupil of UNILAG Women Society Nursery and Primary School, located at Akoka, Yaba, Lagos, by penetrating her private part with his finger.
