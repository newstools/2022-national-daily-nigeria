Some angry youths upon seeing the corpse, descended on the suspect, beating him to stupor.
They tried to set him ablaze before vigilante operatives whisked him away to their office from where police authorities were contacted.
As at time of filling this report, the corpse of the young girl was still laying inside his room while youths are demanding that the suspect be released so they can set him ablaze.
Investigation reveals that the community had agreed that anyone that kills in the town must be killed and his house set ablaze.
This resolution followed a similar incident that occurred in the town when a young man who killed a woman was also set ablaze and his house burnt by mobs.
