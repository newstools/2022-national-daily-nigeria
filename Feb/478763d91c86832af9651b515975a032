The Convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Prof. Ango Abdullahi, has led some northern elders to meet with former President Olusegun in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.
Abdullahi and his team met Obasanjo behind closed doors on Tuesday evening to discuss issues affecting the nation, especially as it goes into the 2023 general election.
Those in the entourage include the Chairman, CNG Board of Trustees (BOT), Nastura Ashir Shariff; and the Director, CNG Action and Mobilization, Aminu Adam.
Speaking after the two-hour meeting, Abdullahi disclosed that the country needed good tidings from the 2023 elections, hence the need to strategize.
He stressed that in spite of their ages, they still deemed it necessary to contribute to the society and the country, hence, the visit to Obasanjo.
He said, “I don’t want to stay away from him for so many months or years without seeing him, especially at this period.
“So, I’m visiting him to say hello and get a briefing from him on how I feel about the nation. We also briefed him on how we feel about the nation. We compared some notes and we agreed on some grounds.”
While saying Obasanjo was on the same page with the northern elders on issues raised, the professor retorted, “Yes. We are on the same page and Insha Allah it shall be well.”
He spoke further, “We have been having challenges and we have been talking on this. You are in the media and you know what we have been saying about the situation in the country. Things are not good enough and as we head for 2023, we hope to be strategising for the good of the nation.”
