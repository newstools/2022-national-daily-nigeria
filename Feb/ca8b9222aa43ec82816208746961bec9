As the race to succeed Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-rufai heats up, Senator Uba Sani, the incumbent lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, is one of the top politicians to keep an eye on as the likely successor. Below is a list of Two Key Reasons Why Sani may emerge as the Next Governor of Kaduna State:
1. His Political Experience, Performance and Cordial Relationship with Governor El-rufai 
According to the Report, a group named the United Awareness Front (UAF) recently encouraged Senator Sani to run for Governor in 2023, citing his outstanding performance. He has a lot of political experience. The Zaria-born legislator earlier served as a Presidential Adviser for two terms (1999-2007) and then as a Special Adviser in Kaduna State.
El-rufai and Uba Sani are also known to be close associates. As a result, he may be able to get the Governor’s support in order to win the APC Governorship Ticket.
2. APC has a Strong Political Structure in Kaduna State 
Without a doubt, the state’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has a formidable political structure. Equally, the party has a huge number of Grassroots Politicians in the state. Also, the incumbency factor may work in his favour.
