“Upon interrogation by the Ilugun Special Squad of the Corps, Alani Sunday, who claimed to be an indigene of Ogun State, confessed that he was taking the child to his other co-kidnappers/ritualists,” Moruf Yusuf, the corps spokesperson said on Friday.
He added that an Automated Teller Machine Card (ATM card) and a handset were found on the suspect.
Alani has been transferred to the Nigeria Police Force, Odeda Divisional Headquarters for further investigation and likely prosecution.
It appears the Gateway state has been invaded by ritual killers. Police and other security agencies have been arresting ritual killing suspects almost by the week since the incident of the Aregba teenagers who beheaded their girlfriend weeks ago.
