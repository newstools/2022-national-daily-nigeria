The Police Service Commission (PSC) has expressed concerns after over 90 percent of applicants for recruitment into the Nigeria Police Force failed to score up to 30 per cent in their examinations.
The Chairman of the Police Service Commission, retired IG Musliu Smith, represented by a Deputy Director, Hawa Komo, at  a one- day sensitization and town- hall meeting on the Police Recruitment Exercise in Birnin Kebbi, expressed perturbation over what such record would translate to in terms of the quality of personnel recruited into the force.
The chairman, however, stated: “The society must encourage upright and responsible citizens to apply for recruitment.
“Police and policing are a noble act and deserves the best of the society to join and change the narrative on the issue of internal security of our nation.”
He emphasized that the sensitization was organized to directly engage with the stakeholders and listen to their stories and anxieties in order to address them for a symbolic relationship with citizens.
There were setbacks during the application period. States in the southeast, south-south and Lagos State had few applicants that did not fill the quotas of the zones. The Police Force had to extend the registration date to encourage more applicants from Lagos and other southern states. Apparently, the applicants for the current recruitment into the police may be dominated by the north.
