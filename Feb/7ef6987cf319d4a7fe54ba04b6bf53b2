Deji Adeyanju, a well-known social media activist, has taken to his official Facebook page to praise President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the amended Electoral Bill into law in response to the people’s outcry. President Goodluck Jonathan finally gave his assent to the electoral bill after months of pressure from Nigerians and careful study by the President, beating the 30-day deadline set by law for any sitting President to assent to a bill.
All political parties must hold their primaries no later than 180 days prior to the election if the electoral bill is signed into law, as well as the electronic transmission of election results, card readers, and more.
Deji Adeyanju lauded the President for signing the bill into law, saying that it would leave a lasting legacy for the President that generations to come would remember. It is true that Mr. President’s request states that candidates need not resign from their positions before running for office, but he did so anyway. According to Deji Adeyanju, anyone who wants to run for office should resign from their current political position so that the government does not have to foot the bill for their campaign.
