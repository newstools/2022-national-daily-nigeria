Despite only taking over the reigns at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, Italian tactician and former Everton boss, Carlo Ancelotti seems to be facing the dead-end of his managerial spell in La Liga, with Real Madrid President, Florentino Perez said to be plotting his sack following yesterday’s 1-0 Champions League defeat to Ligue 1 giants, Paris Saint-Germain.


According to reports from Major Spanish Outlet, Sport (via Football Talk), Perez is currently weighing up his options and could end up parting ways with the 63 year old at the end of the season.
As per the reports, the Spanish giants are frustrated with how the team played against the Mauricio Pochettihno men who dominated them from the start to the end and hence, believe that the Italian’s tactics are outdated.
Meanwhile, multiple Spanish sources suggest that the La Liga club may look to poach the Ligue 1 giants’ boss, Mauricio Pochettihno from under the noses of Premier League side, Manchester United who are understood to be keen on the Argentine.
