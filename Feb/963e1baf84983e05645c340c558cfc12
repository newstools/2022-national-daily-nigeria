One of the greatest basketball players of all time, John Stockton has revealed why he took a stand on COVID mandates, describing it as morally wrong.
In an exclusive interview on “RFK Jr. The Defender Podcast,” with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, Stockton, who is one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, said he refused to wear a mask during games he attended as a spectator
According to him, officials at Stockton’s alma mater, Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, last month told Stockton they needed to suspend his basketball season tickets because he refused to wear a mask during games he attended as a spectator.

Stockton said university officials told him, “We can’t have you not wearing a mask.”
“I didn’t feel like I could morally wear a mask to the games because it means so much, it means so much more when it comes to the autonomy that we should have with our bodies, that I couldn’t do it.”
Stockton had a child who was injured by a vaccine 30 years ago, and it changed his perspective, he said. So it wasn’t a leap for him to question the COVID vaccines.
“A governor can step in and mandate an experimental drug to anybody that wants to live in the state and live a normal life, otherwise suffer the consequences. And to me, that doesn’t seem right.”
Asked by Kennedy why he thinks healthy athletes are being told what they must put in their bodies, Stockton replied: “I wish I could think of how many times I’ve thought to myself, well, this can’t happen in the United States. It can’t happen in the world.”
