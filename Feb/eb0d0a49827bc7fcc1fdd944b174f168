An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Friday ordered that a 52-year-old man, Chukwunonso Igwemba, be remanded for allegedly defiling a 15-year-old girl and procured an abortion for her.
The police charged Igwemba, who resides in Apapa, Lagos State, with defilement and killing of an unborn child.
Magistrate A.O. Ajibade, who did not take the plea of Igwemba, ordered that he should be remanded in the Kirikiri Correctional Centre.
Ajibade directed the police to send the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice.
She adjourned the case until Feb. 28 for the DPP’s advice.
Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, DSP Kehinde Ajayi, told the court that Igwemba committed the offence sometime in February 2018 at Okiro Olodi Apapa, Lagos.
He said that Igwemba first defiled the girl when she was 13 years old.
She said that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 137 and 263 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
