A 43-year-old man identified as Ademola Oladimeji was on Monday February 14, arraigned before an Ikeja magistrates’ court after being arrested for defiling his three daughters and beating up their mother when she confronted him.
Oladimeji, a resident of Fadeyi area of Lagos who was arraigned on two-count charge of defilement and assault, committed the offences in 2021.
The prosecutor, DSP Kehinde Ajayi said the mother of the girls told the police that her husband had been defiling their daughters aged nine, seven and five by inserting his finger into their private parts.
