Former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye has mocked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the multiple delays and postponements of its national convention.
Melaye who took to his social media pages on Wednesday evening described the APC as the “most inconsistent political party in Africa.”
National Daily recalls the APC had earlier scheduled its National Convention to hold on February 26, 2022, but a few days to the date, the party announced a change in plans and chose March 26 as the new date.
This development has continued to attract various reactions from cross-sections of Nigerians.
In his own reaction, Melaye after describing the APC as inconsistent, also said those contesting the National Chairmanship position in the party have to pay more to keep their campaign billboards active after the change in date.
The former Senator also predicted that an individual without billboards may eventually be the one to emerge as the new APC chairman.
He wrote: “Oh boy!!! Apc National chairmanship Aspirants don hear am oooo. So dem go pay for another month again for billboard display…since early last year. Most inconsistent political party in Africa. Person wey no get billboard sef fit come be thier chairman ooo. SDM”
