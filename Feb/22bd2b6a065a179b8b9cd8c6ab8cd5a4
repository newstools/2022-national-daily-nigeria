 Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has engaged in mobilizing support for candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Council election in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Saturday, 12 February 2022. The former vice president therefore, urged FCT residents to come out en masse, exercise their franchise in the election, and cast their votes for PDP candidates.  Atiku, in a statement on Tuesday, indicated that the Saturday council election in the FCT should be a referendum of sorts of the performance of the incumbent APC administration in the country.
 
The former Vice President noted that the people of the FCT, with their closeness to the seat of power, represent a good sampling of Nigerians about the current government and, therefore, should use “their ballot to tell the APC government how its administration has made life difficult for the common man.”
According to Atiku, “The records of performance between the PDP and APC administrations should provide a guide for the way the people of the FCT should cast their ballot on Saturday.
“I expect every member of the PDP to be proud of the party at this election and even mobilize their families and friends to vote for PDP’s candidates across all the FCT councils on Saturday.”
The  presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 general elections also called on all officials, including security agents who will be involved in the conduct of the FCT election to ensure that it is conducted in line with all relevant provisions that will make the process hitch-free and credible.
