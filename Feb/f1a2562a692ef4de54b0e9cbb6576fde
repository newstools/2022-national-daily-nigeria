As the 2023 presidential election draws closer, the fight and strategy by political parties on who to replace President Buhari in Aso Rock intensifies. The ruling party has been trying to put their house to see how they can retain power, but it seems that it is a difficult task for them in doing so. Currently, it has been gathered from a reliable source that the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for February 26 may not be held on that day after all. It gathered that the convention will be postponed by two weeks.
Though there is no formal announcement yet, it was gathered from a very reliable party source that the (CECPC) and the APC governors would meet President Muhammadu Buhari to propose a new date. Many have been wondering what could be the reason for the alleged postponement of the convention, below are likely reasons why the convention could be postponed.
First, one of the things that ought to have been done was the zoning of party offices. People have not bought forms and people cannot buy forms if the zoning is not done, and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don’t know the zoning, you can’t buy a form.
Secondly, there are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. It should be recalled that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees besides the main convention committee. Currently, no major committee has been set on board to show that the convention will hold.
Thirdly, All the governors, party leaders, and stakeholders were awaiting the return of President Muhammadu Buhari from Belgium last night to take a final decision on the convention and the choice of a new national chairman. It should be recalled that before Buhari jetted out to Brussels for the EU-AU Summit, there was a consensus on ceding the slot to the North-Central.
