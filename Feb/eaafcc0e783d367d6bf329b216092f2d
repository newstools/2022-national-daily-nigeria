Aregbesola, absent, lost his Ward 8, Ifofin in Ilesa East Local Government, to Oyetola on Saturday.
According to a loyalist, Aregbesola was not around to vote because of urgent national assignment.
At Aregbesola’s ward, his candidate, Moshood Adeoti, polled 146 votes while Oyetola polled 309.
The former governor’s group and the incumbent’s faction have been at war for more than three years.
Aregbesola exploded during the week that his mentor and party leader Bola Tinubu was playing God by taking side with Oyetola who is bent on destroying his predecessor’s legacies in Osun.
