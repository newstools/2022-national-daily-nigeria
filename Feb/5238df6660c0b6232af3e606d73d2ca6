Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, on Wednesday, said he has not said he will be running for president in 2023.
Wike said the most important thing is to ensure that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is united.
The Governor stated this in Jos where a former Governor of the state, Jonah Jang is being arraigned.
Wike said he was also in Jos to unite the Plateau State PDP, which has been factionalized between two camps of Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni and former governor Jonah Jang.
According to him: “What is important is that you must have a party before an election. If you don’t have a party, what is the essence of running an election.
“Plateau State is ripe for PDP to take over because the APC have performed woefully both at the national and state level and I stand to be corrected.
“But the Plateau PDP cannot not take over the State if they are not united: therefore every one should keep his aspiration and focus on uniting the party so as to salvage Plateau State and the country”, Wike said.
