MTN Group has announced the rebranding of all that encompasses what it does in a bid to achieve leading digital platforms for Africa’s progress.
Africa’s largest telecommunications company said it will officially rebrand itself into a technology company while also adopting a new logo and slogan on February 27
The new look, which is already visibly on display outside its Johannesburg headquarters, will take effect group-wide.
It opted for a much more simplistic look as they did away with the white, yellow text alongside a red accent on a blue oval and white border.
