The Oluwo of Iwo land, Abdulrasheed Akanbi, has rubbished the letter circulating on social media concerning his upcoming wedding to an unnamed princess from Kano State.
According to the letter, the monarch wrote Governor Gboyega Oyetola to request the support of the Osun state government for the financing of his upcoming wedding.
The monarch said the estimated amount for the event is above N20,000,000.
The letter from the palace reads: “I have the instruction of His Imperial Majesty, Oba (Dr) Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo to notify you of the Oluwo’s decision to marry a Princess from Kano Emirate, to be precise Ado Bayero dynasty.

“I wish to remind Your Excellency that the kind of royal wedding within two notable traditional institutions in Nigeria will require huge expenses, which necessitate the support of state government financially even logistically.
“Moreover, the estimated amount for the event is above N20,000,000. His Excellency, Oba Akanbi relies on you for necessary consideration and approval on this request.”
However, the monarch told the BBC on Friday that the letter is fake.
He, however, confirmed that he is getting married to a lady from Kano but didn’t reveal the name or the family.
Oluwo also didn’t reveal the date. He said details will be made public at the appropriate time.
