Christian Eriksen should make his Brentford debut in Saturday’s English Premier League (EPL) match against Newcastle United.
The Denmark international has built up his match fitness in behind-closed-doors fixtures.
He is now in line to make a first competitive appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch at Euro 2020 in June last year.
Bees striker Ivan Toney has recovered from a calf issue, while defenders Mathias Jorgensen (thigh) and Julian Jeanvier (knee) and midfielder Tariqe Fosu (thigh) all remain sidelined.
Newcastle United head coach Eddie Howe hopes to have striker Allan Saint-Maximin available for the trip to west London.
The Frenchman has been in Monaco this week for specialised and intense treatment on the calf injury.
It was an injury which kept him out of last weekend’s 1-1 draw at West Ham and the Magpies will make a late decision on him.
Winger Ryan Fraser has recovered from a hamstring problem and Javier Manquillo’s ankle injury is improving.
But fellow full-back Kieran Trippier (fractured metatarsal), midfielder Matt Ritchie (knee) and striker Callum Wilson (calf) are still out.
