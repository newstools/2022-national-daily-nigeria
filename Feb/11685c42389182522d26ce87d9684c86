Civil Society coalition has issued President Muhammadu Buhari February 22 ultimatum to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. The coalition threatened mass action across the country if by 22nd February President Buhari does not sign the amended bill into law.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had also stated that the 2023 general elections may be postponed if President Buhari does not sign the electoral act amendment bill by Tuesday next week, which coincides with the February 22 ultimatum issued by civil society.
The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room argued that it will be a subversion of popular will if the president declines to sign the electoral act bill, lamenting that it is frustrating.
The coalition argued that President Buhari no longer has any more excuses not to sign the electoral act bill.
All the issues President Buhari requested the National Assembly to review have been reviewed and adjusted to suit the President’s conditions upon which he will sign the bill.
