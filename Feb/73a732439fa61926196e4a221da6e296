Emeka Ugwuonye, a lawyer, has threatened to sue Air Peace Airlines for allegedly disserving him and putting him through “pain and suffering”.
Ugwuonye narrated how he had booked an Abuja-Lagos flight scheduled for 4:25 pm on Saturday, but Air Peace kept rescheduling his flight.
“I got to the airport by 2 pm. At the check-in counter, they told me they rescheduled my flight to 8:10 pm. I wondered why they did not send any message to inform me. I had to cancel my meetings with my staff in Lagos. My driver was already at the airport in Lagos,” he said.
 Around 9 pm, Ugwuonye said, Air Peace announced that the flight would take off at 10 pm. Thinking it would be too late to drive to his house on arrival in Lagos, he attempted to return to Abuja.

However, Air Peace could not produce his luggage, as they had flown it to Lagos on the earlier flight that was delayed.
“They forced me to stay back at the Abuja airport. By 10 pm, they announced they had moved the flight again to 11 pm. Finally, the 4:25 pm flight took off at 11:43 pm, and we arrived in Lagos by 12:33 am. I spent over an hour at the airport trying to find my luggage where the airline kept it. I went through an ordeal to get home by 3 am,” he said.
Ugwuonye also said he saw one of Air Peace’s airline operators show disregard for Nigerians, and this put him through “pain and suffering”.
“I became convinced that unless I dragged Air Peace through the courts, it would continue in such vicious and abusive conduct. I have therefore directed our lawyers to sue Air Peace for damages. I believe this action will be in the public interest,” he added.
Air Peace could not be reached through calls and texts as at press time.
