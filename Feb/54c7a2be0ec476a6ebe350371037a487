Consequently, the explosion led to a fire outbreak that consumed part of the station.
The fire, according to sources, started around 10 in the morning.
A spark allegedly triggered the explosion.
The Director, Anambra State Fire Service, Martin Agbili, said his men had put off the fire.
“At about 09:53 am today (Friday), we received a distress call of a fire outbreak at a Petrol Filling Station at 7th Mile, Ogidi,” he said.
“Our fire trucks and firefighters were deployed to the fire incident scene. Anambra State Fire Service, Awka, Nigeria and Federal Fire Service were there to fight the fire. The fire had been completely controlled and extinguished now.
“There was no loss of life while the filling station was saved; the fire affected the tanker. The cause of the fire outbreak was a result of a spark from the pumping ground during their transloading process.
“We will continue to tell petrol filling station owners to stop discharging and transloading under the intensity of the sun or during the day. This practice is best done in the night or at the early hours of the morning.”
