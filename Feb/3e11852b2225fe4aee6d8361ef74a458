There seems to be some level of anxiety and confusion in Lagos as fuel scarcity appears to have hit some parts of the state, especially the island axis.
This is coming at a time when the controversy on the petrol subsidy removal or otherwise still rages on.
There were unusually long queues of vehicles at various filling stations in Ikoyi, Victoria Island and Lekki trying to buy the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), otherwise known as petrol, which was thought to have been caused by increased demand of the product due to power blackout.
The long queues at the filling stations which have been causing traffic in those locations seem to have persisted on Monday morning despite improved power supply.

However, the situation appears to be different on the mainland part of Lagos as there have not been reported cases of long queues at filling stations or fuel scarcity, as it appears normal and stable.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, has always allayed fears of any hitch in the supply of petroleum products assuring of their availability, despite reported cases of scarcity of these products especially petrol, in some parts of the country.
Investigation shows that the queue started at the weekend, and persisted throughout the weekend and seems to have continued on Monday morning.
