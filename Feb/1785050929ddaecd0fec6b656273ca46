The 2023 presidential election is fast approaching. Many political leaders and the majority of Nigerians in the country are looking forward to it.

Some political gladiators in the country have declared their intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Few of those who have declared their intention include former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Governor Dave Umahi, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal.
One of the key aspirants, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has done two important things that prove he is ready to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
1. He is the first aspirant to inform President Buhari of his intention to contest for President before others began to visit Buhari to inform him of their intention to succeed him.
He has been nursing his presidential ambition long before most aspirants began to show up.
2. He has been consulting traditional rulers and influential politicians since he declared for presidency.
The former Lagos State Governor has been making political consultations with traditional rulers while asking for their prayers and support. Some of the monarchs he has visited include Alaafin of Oyo, Awujale of Ijebuland, Alake of Egbaland among others.
He has visited notable and influential politicians across the country which includes former military President, Ibrahim Babangida, former Abia State Governor, Orji Uzor Kalu, and Northern leader, Tanko Yankasai.
