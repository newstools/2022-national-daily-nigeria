We usually expect our politicians to look good and clean as they are the representatives of our nations. However it seems some ministers just do not care.
One tweep posted that people should google search the Minister of Water Affairs In Sudan. Some people did that but they were not happy to see what they saw when they saw the pictures of the Minister.
Chris Excel tweeted that he looked like a hobo. Some people said that he looked like he won’t be using even a drop of the water.
Things that people do not know about this guy, who goes by the name of Mabior Garang is that he happens to be the youngest Minister in Sudan and has networth of $700 million. He comes from a wealthy prominent family and has been a leader of a rebel group.
I guess we should never judge a book by it’s cover as we might find out that they have more worth that we can ever imagine.
