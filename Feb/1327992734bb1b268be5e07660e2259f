The daughter of Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich who goes by the name of Sofia has reacted to the recent invasion of Russia on Ukraine, and in my own opinion I think she’s right.
It is no longer news that Russia and Ukraine are at a war against each other, and with the people who are against Russian president, Vladimir Putin in the case, Roman Abramovich’s daughter has joined them.
Sofia who is the third daughter of Roman Abramovich’s seven children took to her Instagram page to slam the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

Sofia said that it’s Putin who wants war with Ukraine and not the entire Russian citizens. Sofia even said that Russia is not Putin.
In her words she said; “Since the western media has been talking about the fact that Putin wants to invade Ukraine or something, which is totally n*ts, it might be a good time to remind that Russia is not Putin.”
What are your thoughts on this, don’t you think Sofia is saying the facts? Kindly leave your comments in the comment section below.
