“There is not going to be another opportunity after the said date, therefore, all candidates concerned should make good use of this ample opportunity to participate in the screening exercise.

“As earlier stated in the previous release, the recruitment exercise is absolutely free, therefore, applicants should be wary of extortionists who might want to use the opportunity to dupe them of their hard earned money.
