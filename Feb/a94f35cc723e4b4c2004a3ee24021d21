According to a report, two APC Governors are prepared to clinch the vice-presidential slot of the All Progressives Congress in 2023.
It was stated that Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, coupled with the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, have been tipped to clinch the vice-presidential slot of the All Progressives Congress.
There is absolutely no doubt that Zulum and Mai Mala Buni are influential personalities in the Northern part of the country. The All Progressives Congress might want to have any of them as Tinubu or Osinbajo’s running mate in 2023.
I see no reason why the All Progressives Congress should pick a Northern candidate for the vice-presidential position in 2023. I think neither Zulum nor Mai Mala Buni should be considered for vice-presidential slot in the 2023 general election.
Zulum or Mai Mala Buni would be a wrong choice if APC is planning to zone their presidential ticket to the South-West. I think Zulum and Mai Mala Buni should be snubbed because a South-East aspirant deserves a vice-presidential slot in 2023.
How would the people of the South-East feel if none of their aspirants were given a slot in 2023? APC shouldn’t expect votes from the South-East region if they pick a Northern candidate as Osinbajo or Tinubu’s running mate.
