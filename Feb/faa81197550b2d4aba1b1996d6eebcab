The Imo former governor stated this on Thursday while responding to questions from State House reporters after a closed door meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
Okorocha was alleged to have misappropriated N2.4 billions while he governed Imo for eight years.
The agency had earlier uncovered millions traced to him, his cronies, and comapnies, and later returned to the state government.
Okorocha said he met the President in order to get justice because the EFCC was still holding his international passport.
“The President said he would take up the matter, especially when he saw the judgment. He said, he will take up the matter and find out what is actually happening. And I hope he will do so. And I believe he will do that,” he said.
“One of the duties of a president is to protect the law of the land. And when an issue comes to an issue of judgment the duty is incumbent on the government of the day to ensure that justice is done.”
