Chelsea hero Ramires admits attitude will be key for tomorrow night’s Club World Cup final.
Chelsea will meet Palmeiras in Abu Dhabi.
Ramires said, “This is something difficult for me to say because I’m not living the reality of the club.
“Perhaps what makes us South Americans have this impression that it’s not as important for the European club as it is for us to win the Club World Cup is the fact that we were born with this obsession.
“From a young age, we learn that this is the pinnacle, fans tease each other about whether or not they have the world title, and this is probably different from the rest of the world.”
