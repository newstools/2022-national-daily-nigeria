A Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja, on Thursday convicted two police officers of armed robbery, and sentenced them to death. The convicted persons identified as former police officers, namely, James Ejeh and Simeon Abraham, were sentenced to death by the presiding judge of the FCT High Court, Justice Peter Kekemeke, for armed robbery.
The policemen were put on trial on October 20, 2017, by the Nigerian Police Force to face two counts charges on conspiracy and armed robbery.
The presiding judge, Justice Peter Kekemeke, in his judgment, noted  that the four witnesses invited by the prosecutor ,in their evidence, corroborated the prosecutor’s case beyond any reasonable doubt, concluding that the prosecutor proved his case.
Kekemeke declared that “the evidence before the court proved that there was a robbery by the defendants and they were armed also.” The Judge maintained that there was an admission of guilt by the defendants and no evidence was stronger than their own admission.
The prosecution counsel, Kufureabasi Ebong, had in presenting his case before the court narrated that the police officers were dressed in their uniform while they robbed one Christe Maker of her personal belongings on her way from the Abuja airport on January 17, 2017, at about 1.00am.
The prosecutor argued that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 6 and 1(2) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special provisions) Act, 2004.
The judge admitted all the evidence in judgment before declaring the police officers guilty and sentencing them to death.
The convicted police officers may, however, appeal the judgment.
