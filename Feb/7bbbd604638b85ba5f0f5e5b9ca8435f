The apartment is painted blue and has its toilet and bathroom carved out with aluminum. The convenience is however very small, making many wonder how it is used.
The photo of the apartment with a tiny space was shared on Twitter by @buttergirlll and later reshared by @floshylopez. Sharing the photo, @loshylopez wrote on the microblogging site:
The photo of the small Lagos apartment has attracted huge reactions on Twitter.
Here are a few of the comments: 
@twit_mide said: “Na phone booth in case u want to make private calls when guest are around.”
@iamtbabz remarked: “Nope I doubt that, I think it’s a lift to another planet because this house can’t be on Earth.”
@PreciousAbuja reacted: “They built a room and decided to turn it into a selfcon just to increase the price.”
@Purebreed_ commented: “Is there no building regulatory agency in Lagos? In saner climes the landlord of this house should be serving time.”
@iamharmani wrote: “Lol and the most annoying thing is that the person that will be taking up the place will move in start furnishing it up like an en-suite room, pop, 3d, expensive blinds, air-conditioned and so many things. Lol like fr? Money that will get you a good apartment in a decent area.”
