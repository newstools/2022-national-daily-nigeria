While Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is yet to declare for the 2023 presidential election, he has been noticed being engaged in deep consultations for adoption by critical stakeholders in the country. Prof Osinbajo has strategically adopted a noiseless pattern that could upstage the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who has relatively made public his presidential ambition for 2023 elections.
Osinbajo may not have the political structure like Tinubu has, he is, however, being reinforced by the perquisites of the office of the Vice president he occupies to consolidate his overtures and lobby for support. He has been receiving heroic receptions in different parts of the country he has visited so far. Osinbajo has been approaching stakeholders in the minority an majority zone, both in the north and the south, at this stage, mostly outside his primary constituency.

The vice president was, paradoxically adopted son-of-the-soil during his courtesy visit to traditional rulers in Bayelsa State a fortnight ago.
Osinbajo also received heroic reception on arrival in Maiduguri, Borne State, where has been scheduled to launch the Borno State Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises Clinic, including commissioning some projects in the state, like a Doctor’s Quarters, an orphanage school and a road network, etc.

Thereafter, the vice president will pay homage to the Shehu of Borno.
Osinbajo has visited several states on recent time, enhancing his popularity.
Tinubu has also been deepening his consultation across the country.
