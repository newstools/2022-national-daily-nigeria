Russian trucks on Saturday were conveying supplies to the military forces in Ukraine to strengthen the war in Ukraine. The trucks were moving in food supplies to the forces, including ammunition and arms.
US officials alleged that the Russian trucks were also making blood and other medical supplies to the military forces which could be used to treat casualties of Russia armies.
The trucks were relayed in a telecast by AlJazeera News monitored by National Daily from Lagos, Nigeria, moving freely on major highways towards Kiev, capital of Ukraine.
The situation in Ukraine has moved from tension to panic as Russian forces are hours away from Kiev, according to President Zelensky of Ukraine.
NATO is perceived to be acting too slow to assist the Ukrainian military in resisting Russian invasion of Kiev.
Russia forces are attacking Ukraine from the sea, air, and land.
The Ukrainian government had distributed 18,000 machine guns to volunteers, calling on able body men to join the armed forces  to defend Ukraine.
