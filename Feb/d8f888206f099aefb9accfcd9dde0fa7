Police Prosecutor has revealed to a Chief Magistrate Court in Yola how a 25-year old pregnant woman, Jamila Ardo, allegedly collected over N2.076 million from her rich Facebook lover by pretending to have been kidnapped.
According to police prosecutor Abubakar Nurudeen, Ardo who was married kept the transaction from her husband while giving her well-off internet suitor the impression that she would marry him.
She reportedly arranged her own kidnap with connivance of a man simply named Abdulaziz, who contacted the Facebook boyfriend, Adamu Ahmed, telling him that she had been kidnapped.
After the negotiation was handled at Jamila’s end by Abdulaziz, Adamu deposited the money in a bank account which he was given. After that, Jamila told Adamu that she had been freed by her captors.
Adamu became suspicious after a while, and notified the police.

Police operatives went to work, relying on the details of the bank account through which Adamu transferred the money. They eventually apprehended the owner of the account named Amina Mohammed.
Amina Mohammed reportedly told the police that her friend, Jamila, requested for her account number so that somebody would send in money for her.
She pleaded not guilty when she was arraigned before a chief magistrate court in Yola charged with criminal conspiracy and kidnapping.
After the not-guilty plea, police prosecutor Abubakar Nurudeen prayed to Magistrate Abdullahi Mohammed Digil to adjourn the matter to enable the prosecution to forward the case file to the director of public prosecution for legal advice.
Magistrate Digil adjourned the case till March 10.
