Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State may have on Tuesday urged the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and other presidential aspirants for the 2023 elections to step down. Governor Bello had on   a consultation meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, argued that the North-Central zone deserves the Presidency more in the 2023 general elections than the Southeast zone and others.
The Kogi Governor pointed out that “the North Central has been the most marginalised since 1960, when the country attained her independence”.
The Governor protested that the North-Central has never produced the president or vice president of the country. He argued that “it is only fair that it produces the next President of the country in the 2023 general elections.”
Governor Bello and former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, are the well-known presidential aspirants from the north central zone.  The governor’s argument somewhat disqualified other presidential aspirants like Tinubu, Rotimi Amaechi, Sam Ohabunwa, Anyim Pius Anyim, Atiku Abubakar, among others, from the presidential race.
