Ahead of the 2023 General Elections, Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, the Incumbent Minister of Transportation is one of the Top Politicians from the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria. Although Amaechi is seen as One of the Potential Politicians who can take over the mantle of leadership from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Although he is yet to indicate.
Although a Former Governor of Lagos State and APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has declared his 2023 Presidential Ambition and his Aspiration has been gaining support but Amaechi stands a better chance to clinch the APC Presidential Ticket if he decides to contest for President.
Amaechi, a Former Governor of Rivers State contributed massively to the victory of President Buhari during the 2015 and 2019 General Elections. Equally, he was recently honoured with a Chieftaincy Title in Buhari’s Hometown, Daura in Katsina State to appreciate his Support for the Incumbent Administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari.
Also, His outstanding performance especially in the rail sector is laudable. The North has benefitted a lot under Amaechi ministerial position. He has successfully completed several rail projects especially in the North. Therefore, If Amaechi decides to contest for President under the APC platform, he might defeat Tinubu at the Primaries.
