A prominent stakeholder of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, member of the APC Lagos Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Tunde Samuel has been proclaimed dead.
Tunde Samuel was identified as the Chairman of the Governing Councils of the Federal University of Oye-Ekiti and the Federal University of Otuoke, Bayelsa State.
He was also a UNESCO and UNICEF International Consultant.
Tunde Samuel was Special Adviser on Education to former Governor Bola Tinubu of Lagos State.
Meanwhile, the Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, eulogized the demised GAC member as a “giant” whose services to the city of Lagos will not be forgotten easily.
According to Speaker Obasa, “Prof. Samuel’s demise is a blow, a pain that would take a long time for us to endure both as residents of Agege, the APC as a family, the GAC, and the entire Lagos State.”
