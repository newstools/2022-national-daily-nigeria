The United States of America has linked recent military coups and unconstitutional change of government in Africa to insufficient governance, a lack of good governance, and corruption. The US, however, disapproved of irregular and unconstitutional change of constitutionally installed government after elections and popular ballot government in Africa through military coups which undermine democracy and development.
The US Commander of the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM), General Stephen Townsend, condemned recent coups in four African countries, threatening that the US will not recognize or support any regime emerging from military coup.
General Stephen Townsend, however, acknowledged that the recent coups in Africa were caused by bad governance, corruption, etc.
The military has in the last 18 months, taken over governments in Mali, Chad, Sudan, and Burkina Faso. The last coup in Guinea Bissau was unsuccessful.
Townsend, had in a virtual briefing, emphasized: “So, I don’t know why all that is, but my guess is that it has to do with insufficient governance, a lack of good governance, and corruption. I think that’s probably the most of it.
“And so, as you know, as I said in my opening statement, the U.S. does not support or condone these unconstitutional changes of government and the broader effect they have on democracy and the progress of democracy. But I think that corruption and a lack of good governance is probably behind much of that.”
