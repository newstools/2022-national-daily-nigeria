It is no longer news that the formal vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, who many people believe to be eyeing the presidential seat in 2023, met his former boss, Olusegun Obasanjo, today in Abeokuta, the capital city of Ogun state.
It was learnt that the meeting was about the coming election. When Atiku was talking to the newsmen, he spoke about one issue that may not go down well with Ohanaeze and Nyesom Wike.
Atiku made it known that he had never failed to get the PDP ticket, and despite all the critics that he may be facing from all sides, there is a high chance that he would also get this ticket too in the primary election that has already got closer.
Ohanaeze, who strongly believes there would be a great injustice in both parties, especially the PDP, that they have been loyal to all this time, didn’t zone their ticket to the region. Atiku’s speeches may also sound like he is daring and wants to take their rights away, which could push them to kick against it anytime now.
Apart from that, Nyesom Wike has been working tirelessly against getting the PDP ticket from the northerners, especially Atiku Abubakar. He already has some people who have ganged up with him on this activity.

Atiku, who also believes that it is time for southern politicians to be the PDP flag bearers, won’t like the confidence words of Atiku and may kick against it and put more effort into knocking Atiku out of getting the PDP ticket.
