President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday declared in a self-shot video from central Kyiv they are all in the country to defend Ukraine’s sovereignty against the invading Russian forces. The Ukraine President made the appearance on Friday to reassure citizens and residents that they are not in the run but are with the military to defend the country’s capital.
President Zelensky in olive green military outfit, standing with the prime minister, chief of staff and other senior aides, outside the presidency building on Friday, declared: “We’re all here. Our military is here. Citizens in society are here. We’re all here defending our independence, our country, and it will stay this way.”

Zelensky in olive green military outfit, standing with the prime minister, chief of staff and other senior aides made the appearance in solidarity with the Ukrainian forces fighting the Russian army, and also dispelling coup pressures from President Vladimir Putin.
President Putin of Russia in a broadcast in Kremlin declared officials of the Ukraine government, including President Zelensky as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. Putin had urged the Ukrainian military to overthrow Zelensky, telling them that the decision is in their hands now.
Zelensky, however, cried out that Russian forces may overrun Kyiv in hours.
The U.S. had offered Zelensky personal security and to rescue to a safe location for protection, but Ukrainian president turned down the offer, insisting on staying and fighting the Russian forces together.
