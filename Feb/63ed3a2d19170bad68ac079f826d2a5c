The All Progressives Congress will most likely choose its National chairman by consensus rather than by the ballot.
This was disclosed by the chairman of the progressives governors forum after a closed door meeting between the 22 APC governors and president Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential villa.
Atiku Bagudu says Mr. President is disposed to the emergence of a consensus candidate and believes this will be in the interest of the party, but also says other aspirants who have indicated interest in the contest are also competent and qualified to occupy the office of national chairman.
The governors have unanimously agreed that zoning and consensus should be incorporated as part of arrangements for the national convention.
The Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir Elrufai who addressed newsmen after the meeting assured the media that there is no division within the ranks of the APC governors against reports in the media.
“We have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones.
“Essentially, the northern zone will have the positions the south have had in the last eight years. And vice versa.
“It is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula.
“We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the available positions and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest.
“So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention,” Elrufai submitted.
