The UEFA Champions League winners, Chelsea who have now been crowned the winners of the world after their victory over Palmeiras.










On Saturday, Chelsea for the first time win the FIFA club world cup after 2-1 victory over the CONMEBOL Champions.
The Blues have won their first club world cup and have enjoyed a tidy cash award following their triumph.
The Stamford Bridge outfit earned a cool £3.68million for being crowned world champions, reports The Sun.





The Blues saw off Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal 1-0 in the semi-finals on Wednesday.





And they followed that up with a nervy 2-1 victory over Palmeiras after extra-time yesterday.
Those two wins saw them lift the Club World Cup to complete their incredible honours list.
And with the tournament a FIFA event, there was a decent £3.68m cheque to accompany the trophy on the plane back to London.
