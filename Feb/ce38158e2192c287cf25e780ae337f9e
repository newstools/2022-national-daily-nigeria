There hasn’t been much heard about former Nigeria president, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in the political scene ever since he lost to Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.
However, there has been a recent trend on the micro blogging platform twitter, calling for the former president to join the 2023 presidential race. In this article, we are going to look at some of the reactions to this trend.
The twitter user above clearly wants to vote for a younger and technologically inclined presidential candidate, and she also pointed out the fact that Goodluck Jonathan can only do 4 years in office if he is elected.

The hash tag is #GEJisComing. If this is to really happen then it would be a very eventful electoral process in 2023. This is because Goodluck Jonathan and Bola Tinubu will be tough political opponent for the vote of Nigerians, also Tinubu said he was ready to get dirty in order to win in 2023.
Below are some of the reactions to the hash tag
