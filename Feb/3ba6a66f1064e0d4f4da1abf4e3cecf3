Blessing John allegedly lured the boy to Mubi where she was looking for a buyer.
DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, the Police Public Relations Officer in the State, said Blessing was arrested as a result of a tip-off.
On investigation, the teenage kidnapper said she wanted to raise money to buy a car, and live big.
“She took the little boy to Mubi to sell, but when she could not reach the buyers on phone, she decided to search for another buyer. She ended up talking to the wrong person, who in turn informed the police,”Ngoroje said.
Blessing told the police she learnt from her friend she could make money by supplying children to ritual killers and human traffickers.
