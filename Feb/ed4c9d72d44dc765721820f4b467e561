It is important to know what your urine looks like before flushing it. Most times we tend not to pay attention to what our urine looks like but however, what your urine looks like has a lot to do with your state of health.
In this article, we will be looking out reasons why you should take a look at your urine just before flushing it. It is important to know whether the colour of your urine is if it’s light or dark in colour. It is also important to know if your urine is foamy or not and also, how it smells because all these can give you an insight into what’s going on in your body.
Here is what your urine says about your health
1. Colour: The colour of your urine can be determined by what you ate and most times it’s not typically a health-related issue. The colour of your urine can be a bit dark, or even light and these might be a result of what you ate. But also if the colour of your urine it’s red or pink it could be a sign that there is blood in your urine. Blood in your urine signifies that you may have kidney-related issues or even prostate issues.
2. Foamy: if you notice that your urine is full meaning, and at the same time it has an unusual colour karma then there is the need for you to see a doctor. This is because foamy urine could be a sign of protein in your urine.
3. Smell: the smell of urine I read that wrong but if you noticed a very strong and offensive smell from your urine then it’s a call for concern. This could be a sign that you might have diabetes, metabolic diseases, urinary tract infection, or bladder infection. When you notice any of these please visit your doctor.
