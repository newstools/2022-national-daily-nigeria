“At exactly 2.15 a.m, we were notified of a fire outbreak at shops attached to the post office within Atakunmosa market, Ereja Square, Ilesa.
“We sprang into action and put out the fire to prevent it from spreading to nearby areas.
“Within 30 minutes of our arrival, we were able to put the fire under control.
“A roll of shops, comprising 12 units, were, however, severely damaged by the fire,” Adekunle said.
